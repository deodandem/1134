Then, find an excerpt from the PEPP entries or a poem which addresses that idea. Finally, write a poem responding to that quotation. Here\u0026rsquo;s a topical constraint: Write about something you fear. You may certainly begin by writing your poem first, before connecting it to a particular idea on rhyme/repetition. Regardless, write a brief paragraph afterwards sharing the quote and reflecting on your process, and how satisfied you are with your response to the cited text. Post by 2/20 at 22:00.

We will take an \u0026ldquo;inductive\u0026rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile? A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas (  Files  Sonnet  129-sonnets.pdf ). 3/8: Art of the Sonnet, selected sonnets\nRead the Introduction (p. 5-25) from Art of the Sonnet.

Discussion Board — Pick a sonnet or ghazal and discuss its relationship with another poem of the same form. See if you can relate the poems with one of the concepts we learned in class, from the theoretical readings of the Encyclopedia. Your comparison may relate to the poems\' differing takes on a similar topic, their enunciative apparati, the degree to which they are \u0026ldquo;hyperbolic,\u0026rdquo; differing uses of ritual and fictional elements, and/or their respective takes on a similar conceit.

Here are some constraints:\n Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion. Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better. During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.  Here are some suggestions for what to present:\n Poem-centric: Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing. Essay-centric: Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications. Idea-centric: Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you\u0026rsquo;d like to include. Class-centric: Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you\u0026rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the last presenters.  These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.\n  May 3:\nMay 5:\nMay 7:\nWeek 14: May 10, 12, 14 — Characters (Presentations) #  May 10:\nMay 12:\nMay 14:\nEssay 4 “Final” (Due 5/19, 22:00)\nCourse-Teacher Evaluations due (online)\nFinal exam period runs from May 19-25.   var tooltipSpan = document.getElementsByClassName("tooltip-reveal"); window.onmousemove = function(e) { var x = e.clientX, y = e.clientY; for (var i = 0; i '}),a.add({id:1,href:'/docs/process/',title:"Process",section:"Docs",content:"Process #  This page strives to connect the revision process to its general significance. It should also help you understand the meaning behind grades, and the strategies you can use to improve them.\nRevision is the writer\u0026rsquo;s equivalent of \u0026ldquo;learning.\u0026rdquo; It is like making a mistake on a quiz or debugging code. On a surface level, the point of fixing something is to get something to function properly. In school, this translates to earning a good grade. But understanding why a mistake is a mistake, and why it was made, is the route to deeply understanding a thing. Nearly all essays written for this class go through a revision process. The hope is that you can learn how to learn through revising, in a way that is applicable to all other endeavors in life.\nIn some cases, the first draft is strong and only requires a few minor changes at the sentence level, or a quick rearrangement of paragraphs. It clearly puts forth a narrative or idea that others can incorporate into their own experiences of the world. Essays of this kind may come out in one fell swoop, but are the result of previous experiences with radical revision. They are also the result of a more immediate history of rewriting that comes with drafting thoughtful slack comments, discussion board posts, and talking to peers. If you are producing competent essays at the outset, challenge yourself to read with greater intensity. Identify texts you admire and mimic them; try on their rhetorical strategies. Seek out supplemental materials. Practice writing multiple introductions. Most decent essays could benefit from a more incisive first paragraph. (A to A-)\nEssays that require more than one revision usually need to be re-thought. Something about the organization of ideas lacks impetus, force. There is no single discovery being made, knowledge being produced, because the parts do not form a functioning, living organism. This may be the result of an overflow of interesting observations, or a lack of oversight, in which a miscellany of first impressions are listed on the page, often due to some kind of unfavorable time constraint. Avoid this state of affairs by starting earlier. Even the most forgiving readers can become anxious or antagonistic when reading something that seems rushed, and become less effective editors as a result.\nOn top of this, essays requiring multiple revisions may have many issues at the sentence level which obscure the reader\u0026rsquo;s ability to discern the larger issues. It\u0026rsquo;s always best to start revising for structure, but it can be difficult to determine where to begin with structure when the essay is hard to read. In this case the editor may prefer to clean up the sentence-level issues first. This way, the structural issues become crystal-clear, and thus easier to fix.\nLike structural problems, issues at the sentence-level can be caused by a lack of time. Reading your writing out loud will help you catch awkward phrasings and grammatical mistakes. More subtle issues are best addressed by spending more time reading essays in the relevant genre or other prose which you admire. When this kind of immersion is not possible, seek out dialogue with a tutor or your instructor. (B+ to B-)\nFinally, there is the case where the writer seems not to have been present in class or to have reviewed the assignment carefully. The resulting essay may need substantive additions or a complete rewrite. (C+ to F)\nTime is always limited, but there are steps you can take to revise more efficiently and therefore earn higher grades. Step 0: Read carefully. Step 1: Contribute your best work to discussions and slack comments. Step 2: Start drafting early, and re-structure your observations until they form a coherent sequence. Step 3: Re-read what you\u0026rsquo;ve written to make sure the sentences work. Step 4: Get another pair of eyes on your essay, through a tutor or friend, or turn in your work early, as the instructor will approach what you\u0026rsquo;ve written with a fresher mind.\nThese paragraphs appear to construct a hierarchy, in which good essays require the least revision. This is only partly true. The strongest essays, which delve deeply into a complex topic and produce surprising or innovative results, are the result of many stages of writing and re-writing. They may be highly chaotic at the outset, and involve some degree of pain and obsession. At this point, you are advised to take frequent breaks, and to share your drafts with trusted readers, who may help you retain bits of writing that would otherwise be deleted by an overzealous mind. The resulting essay is alive and beautiful. It grows into something like H.D.\u0026rsquo;s sea rose, and persists like the pear trees of Ponge.

During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.  Here are some suggestions for what to present:\n Poem-centric: Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing. Essay-centric: Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications. Idea-centric: Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you\u0026rsquo;d like to include. Class-centric: Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you\u0026rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the last presenters.  These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.\n  11/30:\n12/2:\nWeek 16: Dec 7 — Presentations #  12/7:\nEssay 4 “Final” (Due 12/10, 22:00)\nCourse-Teacher Evaluations due (online)\nFinal exam period runs from Dec 11-18.   var tooltipSpan = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tooltip-reveal\"); window.onmousemove = function(e) { var x = e.clientX, y = e.clientY; for (var i = 0; i "}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/writing/',title:"Writing",section:"Docs",content:"Essay Horizon #  The essay sequence is designed to lead you to a final paper. Each of the assignments emphasizes a different skill, mode of argumentation, or type of writing. Here's a brief synopsis of what you should be learning by completing each essay: Essay 0: Centers observation, reveals what you are accustomed to seeing in poems. The most successful essays are detailed but concise, and follow the tripartite structure (first impression, second impression, reflection) with fidelity. This is a bit like a journal entry, or a field report.\nEssay 1: Centers observation, under a specific formal vocabulary (rhyme, line, meter). Tests your ability to link one formal technique with varied aspects of the poem\u0026rsquo;s tonality and meaning. The essay is more or less academic in genre, in that you will be using a \u0026ldquo;method\u0026rdquo; to analyze a text.\nEssay 2: Centers comparison. You will use the formal vocabulary (ritual, fiction, voice, etc.) to analyze how a poem diverges from or relates to another poem that represents a certain \u0026ldquo;tradition.\u0026rdquo; Or, you may analyze a single poem, discussing multiple ways in which it might be \u0026ldquo;interpreted.\u0026rdquo; This is also a more or less academic essay, though you might try writing in a more journalistic style.\nEssay 3: This essay may resemble the personal essay, the short story, or other forms of creative non-fiction. You will work on describing the world of a poem and what draws you to it. You may still incorporate the more technical mode of analysis from Essay 1 or the more argumentative and dialectical mode of Essay 2 in forming this piece.\nEssay 4: You may choose to expand what you wrote for Essay 0, Essay 1, Essay 2, and Essay 3, or to write a new essay whose thesis will be driven by whatever text(s) you are writing on. You may also choose to write a poem in response to a poem and write about the compositional process.\n"}),a.add({id:4,href:'/docs/markup/',title:"Markup",section:"Docs",content:'Markup Guide #  This page strives to guide you through the process of marking up texts, with a slight focus on the kinds of essays that you will be producing for this class. The goal is that this would aid reading speed and comprehension, but more importantly that it allows you to identify particular rhetorical strategies that you may use them in your own writing.\nWhen we read essays for this class, it is rare that we read them solely to absorb their message. Like poems, essays use specific linguistic strategies to attract and sustain readers\' interest. These mechanisms are analogous to those of \u0026ldquo;poetics,\u0026rdquo; but are often categorized under the art of \u0026ldquo;rhetoric,\u0026rdquo; or persuasion. Being aware of these rhetorical mechanisms every time you read can help you fluently integrate those which are particularly powerful and avoid those which are less serviceable in your own writing.\nEthos + Pathos #  Rhetoric comes from the Greek word ῥήτωρ (root verb εἴρω, \u0026ldquo;I speak\u0026rdquo;), meaning speaker, orator, statesman, or judge. Aristotle identified three categories of rhetoric: ethos, pathos, and logos. Ethos can be thought of as the character—which includes moral beliefs and general knowledge—of the speaker. Pathos can be thought of as the emotions that the listener brings with them. In the context of the classroom, it might seem like the logos—the quality of the words and arguments themselves—is all that matters. After all, you produce written works for class, and these are designed to be read at a distance, at different times. Yet the environmental aspects of oratory don\u0026rsquo;t just disappear with the invention of writing. We might still reasonably ask: Do you trust the writer? Are you feeling relaxed and receptive as you read this? How can we, when we write, foster a mutually beneficial relationship between the (imagined) reader and the writerly voice we construct? Whether real or imagined, the relationship between reader and writer continues to activate all texts.\nThinking about ethos and pathos is thus necessary to the production of strong logos, especially in the modern age. When we engage in oral conversation, much of what we communicate is not verbal content, but what cognitive scientists call \u0026ldquo;backchanneling\u0026rdquo;—gestures like nods to show we are following, or phatic words like \u0026ldquo;mhm\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;yeah.\u0026rdquo; When you see your friend nod and smile a lot, you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to continue on your current train of thought. If they seem cold or confused, you might pause or ask for a response, and the direction of the conversation shifts. You can see how much the background attitudes of speaker and listener—roughly analogous to ethos and pathos—can alter the shape of a conversation\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;narrative arc,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;plot,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;argument.\u0026rdquo; Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try to see how this works in essays. Here\u0026rsquo;s a battery of questions to ask:\n What\u0026rsquo;s the role of the opening paragraph in this essay? We say it introduces, but what does it introduce? Background information, yes—but why, and in what way? Does the speaker attempt to show their knowledge or their values? Does the speaker bring a particular emotion with them? Would you like to meet this person, or is the question of their identity irrelevant? If not, what is relevant to you? What attitudes and affective states do you bring to the reading? Do you need a jolt of energy, or something soothing to calm you down? Does the essay itself seem to bring a certain expectation of how you might behave? Do you think it requires a learned reader? Does it speak to people of a similar \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo; or an \u0026ldquo;in-group\u0026rdquo;? How would you define its audience?   Now, to markup: highlight sentences that lead you to a response to any of these questions, and jot down: ETHOS: [—]. Fill in the blank with whatever comes to mind. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample list: \u0026ldquo;interested in the environment, learned.\u0026rdquo; Here\u0026rsquo;s another: \u0026ldquo;critical.\u0026rdquo; Here\u0026rsquo;s yet another: \u0026ldquo;absorbed, quick-witted.\u0026rdquo; You can do the same with PATHOS, but it may be even simpler to denote: \u0026ldquo;✓\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;:)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;:(\u0026rdquo; can designate how you react to specific highlighted moments. You can also write a separate brief description of your mood prior to the reading of the text, and of what has led you here (\u0026ldquo;assigned for class,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;found while surfing JSTOR on friday night,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sent to me by my crush,\u0026rdquo; etc.) Do the same after reading, in an effort to reconstruct the ethos of the speaker and your updated pathos. What kinds of things is this person interested in studying and why? What values and proclivities led to their particular conclusion? How do I feel about the conclusion: interested, excited, overjoyed, bored, underwhelmed—what does that say about my own values and preferences?\nEthos + Pathos = Logos #  The above markup directives may feel pretty natural and fun, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t in themselves enough to help you learn how to write better—not without attention to the particular bits of language you chose to highlight or react to. Take a moment to look over what you\u0026rsquo;ve marked up. What kinds of language are you finding? Do you have more highlights on sentences that being with prepositions or \u0026ldquo;transition words,\u0026rdquo; or on sentences with particularly vibrant verbs, nouns, or adjectives? Can you connect specific emotional states with particular sentence structures or types of words? Some example statements below—\n The word "moreover" is soothing to me.  I get a spike of energy when I see a barrage of questions.  The author seems pompous whenever she uses the phrase "indeed."  The typos on page 26 and 30 makes me feel like the author wrote this really quickly and that his editors didn\'t even care to read the whole thing.  The paper begins with a conjunction. I find this disorienting but inviting.  The use of lists and parataxis in this essay fits the subject matter (Whitman\'s poems) and increases my trust that the author really "gets" Whitman.  The frequent use of quotation gives me the impression that this author is very detail oriented, or that she has a prodigious memory.  The author keeps citing dictionary entries to explain simple terms to me, which make me feel like he thinks I\'m really naïve.  By the end of this process, you should be more aware of some of the smaller details in language—from syntactic structure to the use of \u0026ldquo;transition words\u0026rdquo; and the like—which you may not be consciously aware of as you read and write, but which are just as crucial as those little \u0026ldquo;uh-huh\u0026quot;s and nods which facilitate conversation.\nFractal Logos #  Still, these little pieces of markup may form a random pile and do not show you how the structure of an essay is formed. How do we know it when we are reading an good argument? How do we figure out how to construct and write up a good argument? Is it all just a random walk, or can you do some overhead planning?\nGood essays, like everything else in the natural world, form a fractal structure. We can approach logos—i.e., good argumentation— from the standpoint of the relations between paragraphs, the relationships between sentences, and even between words and sounds. Let\u0026rsquo;s just focus on the first two levels for now, in reverse order:\n Sentence-to-sentence – Identify a sentence in each paragraph that stands out to you as most important. Most paragraphs contain meaningful "cores," which may be found at the beginning or towards the end. Ask yourself what this "core" does. Does it label or sum up the paragraph\'s main message? Does it create a sense of intrigue and lead into the next paragraph or idea? And how does it relate to the sentences that come before or after? Ex: I highlighted the first sentence because all the rest seem to expand on it.\nEx: This sentence presents a fact but the others that follow question the fact. Is is really as simple and objective as it seems?\nEx: I highlighted the question in the center of the paragraph because it ties the fairly self-explanatory initial observation to the more complex one addressed later on.\nEx: The last sentence here is clearly the thesis statement. It responds to the question that was put forth earlier by putting forth some ideas on how to respond, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully answer it, so we\u0026rsquo;re compelled to continue reading.\nEx: I just like this sentence because it\u0026rsquo;s beautifully written, but complex. I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand it initially, but the subsequent sentences paraphrase it in different ways, so by the end of the paragraph I do feel like I \u0026ldquo;get it.\u0026rdquo; \n Paragraph-to-paragraph – Consider the breakpoints between each paragraph as pauses, where the speaker and listener look at one another in order to determine the present state of affairs. Shall we continue onto a new topic, or elaborate upon the current one further? Make margin notes at paragraph transitions. Highlight words and phrases that signal a particular attitude or logical relationship... Ex:  The author expands on what he means by \u0026ldquo;triplet\u0026rdquo; here. The previous paragraph is mainly about how the author\u0026rsquo;s favorite lines, 4-6, seem to hold the central image of the poem, so its logical to delve into the form here. Furthermore, he signals the change by writing, \u0026ldquo;In order to\u0026hellip;,\u0026rdquo; which makes it explicit that this paragraph exists \u0026lsquo;in service to\u0026rsquo; the previous one.\nEx:  Both of the two previous paragraphs and the current one begin with the word \u0026ldquo;This.\u0026rdquo; It feels like he\u0026rsquo;s pontificating and has lost track of his audience.\nEx:  Both this paragraph and the previous one develop on the author\u0026rsquo;s biography. However, the previous one is about her relationship to Imagism and this one is about her later work. \nEx:  The previous paragraph begins with \u0026ldquo;First,\u0026rdquo; and this one with \u0026ldquo;Second.\u0026rdquo; I appreciate the sequential markers because otherwise I would have no idea why these two observations are related. Is she going to make a connection later on?\nEx:  The paragraph begins with a concession: \u0026ldquo;By this, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to suggest that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This implies that the author expects her audience to have raised an objection in the previous paragraph, where she proposes a new term. I think this is an important paragraph because it responds to my skepticism of her attempt to use the word \u0026ldquo;fiction\u0026rdquo; to describe poetry.\n Whole Essay – This is a kind of paragraph-to-paragraph analysis, but non-local. How does the essay begin, and how does it end? Do you nod your head in assent afterwards, after having begun with trepidation or suspicion? Do you walk away in disgust, because you are disappointed or offended by its close? Not much to mark up here, but you can produce some quick reflections: Ex: I liked the move from objective to inclusive language at the end—the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026quot;s felt very powerful, but the rich descriptions in the beginning helped me get absorbed with the material and established trust as I knew the author had a really strong command of the material.\nEx: I expected a descriptive report of this poem\u0026rsquo;s use of line and meter but was pleasantly surprised to find the author\u0026rsquo;s interpretations of how all those details pertained to the poet\u0026rsquo;s biography. It made the piece feel more personally relevant to me as a reader.\nEx: The parallelism between the first and last paragraphs was quite effective. She begins with a quote, and ends with the same quote. But the quote feels entirely different the second time around, and it really demonstrates how much I\u0026rsquo;ve learned after having read the essay.\nSummary #  OK, so you\u0026rsquo;ve read through this and want a summary of how to mark up texts for rhetorical devices, so that you can submit your slack comments for class.\nHighlights – there are three major types—those pertaining to PATHOS, those pertaining to ETHOS, and those pertaining to LOGOS. Sometimes they intersect. Pathos—things you react to. Ethos—things that relate to your impression of the author. Logos—Specific sentences that you identify as \u0026ldquo;cores,\u0026rdquo; as well as pieces of language that stand out to you because of how they make you feel.\nNotes – Describe how these highlights make you feel, how they relate to adjacent sentences, or how their linguistic structures correlate with their meaning/effects. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to write notes on every highlight. Try writing notes on one highlight of each type. Then decide on what element of rhetoric you\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on. Then write notes for several if not all of the highlights you\u0026rsquo;ve made under that category.\nZero #  These are directives for the slack comments in #rhetoric.\nRead the article without marking it. If it\u0026rsquo;s very long, stop whenever you start to lose focus, and start annotating there, for a page or two. Then go to the beginning, and highlight/notate it more heavily for ethos/pathos. Then go to the end, and mark it for ethos/pathos. If you were able to read the whole thing, reflect on the whole-essay logos. Look over your marginal notes and highlights again, pick one that\u0026rsquo;s most interesting or helpful to you. Share a screenshot of that page on slack.\nOne #  \u0026hellip; And this is how you apply it to your own writing.\nYou may have to practice markup fairly regularly or a few times intensely before you begin to employ effective linguistic structures and rhetorical techniques in your own writing with ease. Before getting to that point, you must explicitly apply the structures you find and admire in your own writing. Mark up at least the first two paragraphs of your essay drafts going forward to check if things are going alright.\nGetting a grasp of rhetoric will also help you discuss texts more readily in class!\nBeyond #  Try marking up texts you admire that aren\u0026rsquo;t essays, like stories, novels, journalistic writing, memoirs, tweets, product reviews, and of course, poetry. See how well the techniques generalize. Think about the differences between rhetoric and poetics. Are all good poems rhetorically successful? If not, how, and why do you think this is the case? Are all rhetorically successful arguments poetic? If not, why is this so? What are your goals as a writer, and what do you prefer to read—texts of a more rhetorical or poetic nature?\n'}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/resources/',title:"Resources",section:"Docs",content:"Resources #   Oxford English Dictionary https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation https://www.library.cornell.edu/services/apps/passkey  Poetry Online  Poetry Foundation Poets.org ubuweb Pennsound  Anthologies  Black Nature The Breakbeat Poets The Making of a Sonnet, ed.

Each of the assignments emphasizes a different skill, mode of argumentation, or type of writing. Here's a brief synopsis of what you should be learning by completing each essay: Essay 0: Centers observation, under few constraints. Reveals what you are accustomed to seeing in poems. The most successful essays are detailed but concise, and follow the two-step structure of the essay with fidelity. This is a bit like a journal entry, or a field report.\nEssay 1: Centers observation under a specific formal vocabulary (line, meter). Tests your ability to produce a succinct description of the essay\u0026rsquo;s overarching method and trajectory, and to fluidly link a heterogenous set of observations under that program. The \u0026ldquo;program\u0026rdquo; in all likelihood takes the form of the basic question: how do line groupings and meter contribute to the meaning of the poem? Some amount of external research may be incorporated to form a sense of the latter. The essay may leave you filled with ideas, overwhelmed, unsure of how to interpret it all. It may result in writing that is either too chaotic or too clinical. But at very least you will feel you have thought a lot and learned from it. This is a mixture between a journal entry and a science experiment.\nEssay 2: Centers persuasion and dialogue; you are responsible for choosing your theoretical vocabulary and showing how it adds to your experience of reading a poem or poems. By doing so, you are making an argument for the value of that term and the value of the poetry you write about. For instance, you may discover that you enjoy poems that are particularly hyperbolic, poems which involve many fictive utterances, or poems which are more ritualistic in nature. Or you may deliberately challenge your tastes by finding a poem you don\u0026rsquo;t immediately like and attempt to understand why using the theoretical terms we have encountered lately. By the end of this assignment, you should feel quite confident in constructing essays with a clear \u0026ldquo;argument\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;purpose,\u0026rdquo; and which likewise employ effective rhetorical \u0026ldquo;turns\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;moves.\u0026rdquo; This is closest to a standard academic essay.\nEssay 3: This one takes on the simpler, bipartite format of Essay 0, and also centers the subjective question, \u0026ldquo;What do you notice?\u0026rdquo; However, it gives you a chance to use whatever new tools you have encountered in this course to describe the \u0026ldquo;studium\u0026rdquo;, and to write in a more personal style when describing the \u0026ldquo;punctum.\u0026rdquo; Some amount of historical and biographical research may be included in order to write about the \u0026ldquo;studium,\u0026rdquo; you may wish to imagine the poet\u0026rsquo;s world, the conditions under which the poem was written. This essay may resemble journalistic writing or creative non-fiction to a greater degree than the previous ones. The main goal of this assignment is to hone your sentence-level writing, to develop a descriptive voice.\nEssay 4: You may choose to expand what you wrote for Essay 0, Essay 1, Essay 2, and Essay 3 or to refactor the prompts in order to design the fourth. The essay should have an intriguing and well-designed argumentative structure, and be fairly well-written on the sentence level. Since you will be given more time and space to write this essay, you will also incorporate some amount of research, which could help you tie this project closer to interests that were not explicitly a part of this class.\n"}),a.add({id:7,href:'/docs/qfa/',title:"Q F A",section:"Docs",content:'QFA* #  *Questions to Frequently Ask\n(1) Do I like the readings? #  University classes are ideally fun and interesting, but are not primarily designed to entertain. Learning is often difficult and cause for discomfort. Sometimes we will read things that are totally mystifying, which were written in older versions of the English language and that are therefore a bit difficult to get into. Many poems take time and repeated readings to become attuned to, but you may find that some are simply not for you. One of the best experiences you can have is to learn to appreciate something you didn\u0026rsquo;t like before, or to see a new aspect of something you do already enjoy.1 However, we write and think best when we\u0026rsquo;re glad to spend time with our thoughts and whatever it is that we are studying. If you\u0026rsquo;re having concerns about not liking the readings for this course, here are a few things you might do:\n Write about your alienation or distaste for a text. Reach out to me and let me know about your concerns. Ask a peer about their own reactions to readings, see if you can get a person who is a fan of a text to explain why they like it. Find poems you do like and try to understand why. Read the text multiple times. Try to understand why it was written. Try to understand a text in terms of its impact on other writers.   Ideally you should ideally use a combination of these tactics to help you find value in texts that are difficult to appreciate. Never feel bad about your reactions to texts, but be careful not to dismiss something too loudly or quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting to hear about others\' responses before coming to a more final judgment.\nWhat am I enjoying most? #  This is a critical question, as it should be the main heuristic for choosing what to write about. The question of taste might be broken down into three components:\n(1) What poems am I enjoying?\nI encourage you to write your final paper on a poem or set of poems that you really like and want to spend time reading and thinking about. Keep in mind that the more you read with care and openness to others\' perspectives, the more likely it is that you will develop a heightened appreciation of whatever poems you end up preferring, which will in turn make the final essay experience more meaningful. (2) What exercises, discussions, and ideas am I drawn to?\nKeeping this question in mind will help you develop a method, a research question, and a more specific analytical toolkit for approaching the poem(s) you love. Often people express a fear that analyzing a work of art will "deaden" it. You should be on the lookout for methodologies that heighten your appreciation of and interest in your topic. (3) What aspects of writing do I feel best about?\nWriting can be a fearsome and paralyzing process. Knowing what you value in writing will help you begin and sustain any complex effort. When you read over your drafts, ask yourself what is going well before jumping to self-criticism. I tend to provide feedback that highlights and amplifies strong points in your writing. Make changes in service of your strengths, not merely to "correct" a perceived weakness. (3) What\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this class? #  Our focus on \u0026ldquo;lyric poetry\u0026rdquo; means that you will be encouraged to read poems closely and repeatedly. Repeated reading is closely aligned with the goal of becoming comfortable with re-reading and revising your own work, which is necessary to becoming a strong writer and an empathetic, astute listener.\nPoetry is a particularly keen source of knowledge and pleasure for writers. The artifice and extremity of poetic language helps produce insights about how language works and what its capacities are more generally.\nPoems can and do cover pretty much every topic under the sun. Everyone should be able to find some poem or poet who effectively engages with extra-poetic interests. As a freshman, one of your main goals this year is to figure out what to major in, and I hope this course will guide you in that process by giving you the latitude to seek out poems that bring you closer to your personal ambitions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to read poetry alone, and to find time for reading anything in this careful and iterative sense. Taking a writing course on reading poetry will provide a special framework for engaging with something that is important and powerful but difficult to access.\n(4) What\u0026rsquo;s my role in this class? #  We\u0026rsquo;re here to learn from each other, and participate in a poetry-reading and writing community. Going to class and entering group discussions should not feel totally separate from whatever thoughts you may be having inside your own head. Writing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a private process.\nThe specifics of your role in this community are for you to determine. You might ask yourself some sub-questions, such as, \u0026ldquo;What makes the study of poetry compelling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How is poetry \u0026ldquo;useful\u0026rdquo; in other domains of knowledge and innovation?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s my relationship to poetry?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What kinds of writing do you want to produce in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the instructor may be the primary leader of the course, he is not the sole arbiter of ideas. Everyone has views that are unique and interesting; everyone is capable of leading discussions and influencing the direction of the course.\n Notes #  [1] \u0026ldquo;Acquired tastes and the pleasures of imitation\u0026rdquo; by William Flesch ↩\n There\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure in the experience of conversion. Wittgenstein writes (of psychoanalysis) that when we are disinclined to accept something, we are also inclined to accept it. Why? Not because disinclination is repression of desire, but because desire comes from the overcoming of disinclination. The pleasure is one of discovery and novelty, if not in the object (how boring Clarissa is!) then in the self (how riveting it is!). We don\u0026rsquo;t see differently, but we alter our relation to seeing. That\u0026rsquo;s a second order experience worth having.\n  Second-order? Even on the receptive side, art is the experience of imitation, and imitation (cf. Roger Caillois, who argues that seeing itself is a mode of imitation, an assimilation of the sole to the visual field it projects itself into)—imitation is the most basic experience of experience that there is, and the most aesthetically intense. Acquired taste is as basic and as intense as it gets.\n '}),a.add({id:9,href:'/docs/writing/0/',title:"Essay 0",section:"Writing",content:"Essay 0 - \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; #  Due Saturday, 8/28 at 22:00\nPeer review due Tuesday, 8/31 at 22:00\nPrompt #  We spent the first class discussing what we mean by the word \u0026ldquo;poetic\u0026rdquo; and reading from several different poems. Your task is now to choose one of these poems and discuss how it corresponds to or wavers from your notion of the \u0026ldquo;poetic.\u0026rdquo; In order to accomplish this, please follow these steps:\n  Spend 15-30 minutes reflecting on what the word \u0026ldquo;poetic\u0026rdquo; means to you. It is best to invoke a specific example; try to tell a story of how you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered this term, rather than an impersonal or generalized definition of the word \u0026ldquo;poetic.\u0026rdquo; If you don\u0026rsquo;t have personal experiences or memories to refer to, you may do some basic research on the word and cite an external resource, but this is a last resort. When you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with what you\u0026rsquo;ve written, take a break.\n  Pick a poem to examine. Preferrably your favorite poem, or your least favorite. Take some time to write about what you notice within it (15-30 minutes). Cite specific textual evidence. You may also cite your affective reactions to the text (e.g., How does it make you feel? What does it remind you of?). You don\u0026rsquo;t have to think too hard about whether these attributes of the poem are \u0026ldquo;poetic\u0026rdquo; or not. The point of this paragraph is to present to your reader what you see as the most important characteristics of a poem which they may not have read carefully themself. Take a break.\n  Reread what you wrote in the first paragraph. Write a third paragraph which connects what you noticed\u0026quot; in the poem with what you believe to be poetic. Make it clear to yourself and the reader—does this poem match with what I consider to be poetic? If so, how? If not, where does it \u0026lsquo;fail\u0026rsquo;? And finally, has your notion of the poetic changed after writing this essay?\n  (See Canvas Files \u0026gt; Slides \u0026gt; August 26.pdf)\nFurther instructions #   You may pick a poem not discussed in class. You may want to do some light research on the author and familiarize yourself with other poems they\u0026rsquo;ve written, but this is not required. There are many things you could \u0026lsquo;notice\u0026rsquo; or comment on when faced with a poem—you may use a pattern-focused approach (what linguistic patterns do I notice?), affective approach (what mood or sensation do I feel?), rhetorical approach (what do I believe the purpose of this text to be?), or hermeneutic approach (what do I think this text means?) to refine the scope of your reading.

Take notes on what you observe. Choose a poem and think about how its lineation relates to its meaning. Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? How is enjambment used in the poem? How long are the lines, and what are their syntactic components? Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that stand out to you? Do these groupings form archetypal patterns like call-and-response or syllogism? Here\u0026rsquo;s a relevant quote from Hass:   The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.\nThe sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox. (11)\n  Choose a poem and read it out loud. Determine which excerpts of the poem appeal to you most, and scan them. See if you notice any patterns in the meter which relate to the meaning or other aspects of your favorite lines (which may include syntax, for instance). Here\u0026rsquo;s one inspirational quote from Hass—   The work of prosody in free verse, as in metrical verse, comes once the poem is under way. The twos and threes, or the fours and threes and then fours; the choice of making stanzas or not making stanzas, what kind of line endings—that work. You are hearing a poem that is grave and slow, or charged and relentless, or hesitant, or easy and fluid, the sense of sound, arc of development, play with undevelopment, image- or thought-cascade occurring and telling you what it wants to be, form and content beginning to be a body. The final form exactly right, or not—seeming just okay, adequate to the task, but not radiant, not the radiance. (428)\n —— Then, write an essay which convinces a reader of the poem that paying attention to your formal object of your analysis (rhyme, lineation, meter) can deepen their appreciation of the poem.\nFurther instructions #   Your essay should demonstrate clear intent to respond to the prompt: it should help the reader see why your analysis of rhyme, lineation, or meter are worth embarking on.  Cite a secondary text to frame your argument or to provide a specific definition of the terms you are using (rhyme, repetition, line-groupings, meter, etc.) Since these are big concepts, your definition will necessarily be partial, so you should make that clear.  The introduction should give us a good sense of why you chose the poem and why you are focusing on a particular form or motif within it. You may do this by giving context (what is the poem about, what is its form, who wrote it, when, etc.), providing a few "teasers" (favorite quotes from the poem), providing material from a secondary source, and/or including a personal anecdote which frames your motivations.  The final paragraph should reflect on how successful your analysis was and whether there were any points deliberately left out for the sake of concision. What are some possible routes for further inquiry, and which seem most promising to you?  When making a general claim, remind the reader of precisely what you are referring to by quoting directly from the text. If you\'re writing about meter, denote meter-markings below a quoted line from a poem using u (unstressed) and \' (stressed) to denote the syllables. Separate feet, if applicable, using / or // for a caesura.  Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible.  Sentences should flow well, meaning that they should employ contrasts in sentence length and structure to help the reader stay engaged; you should also edit out any unwanted repetitions of words or phrases.  If a sentence leads into digressive or speculative territory, there should be a clear justification for this maneuver.  Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially prepositions and verbs.  Use the proper tense (mostly present) and person (mostly first and third). Avoid the pronoun "it" unless the antecedent is clear, avoid the passive voice where an active verb would work instead. A good way to check for this is to search for the verbs "is/has/has been" in your paper.  Include proper in-text citations (including citations of line numbers).  Transcribe the poem and include it in the Appendix of your paper (before the Works Cited page). If it is more than 14 lines long but less than 50, then you should include line numbers (copying the poem into a table with invisible cell lines is a good way to do this). If it is much longer, you can refer to page numbers rather than lines. The template on Canvas may be helpful.  The body of the paper should be around 4 pages, with a descriptive title, MLA formatting, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page.

Does it recapitulate a common theme, and if so, does it contribute something new? Be sure to cite two poems: one which represents the tradition, and another which forms the center of your analysis. You may cite and mention additional poems as reference points.  Write about a poem that seems particularly "lyrical" to you and one which seems less so; discuss why this is the case. This may help readers understand what makes some poems more poetic than others, or it may help them better appreciate the latter poem.  Describe the "enunciative apparatus" of a poem. Who is involved? What are the relationships between writer, speaker, addressee, and reader? Can you localize instances of the "three voices" of poetry in this poem? Be sure to justify your interpretation by discussing multiple ways in which the enunciative apparatus could be framed.  Specifications #   Capture the reader\'s attention and produce a sense of intrigue in the opening paragraph. Make it clear that the poem you are writing about is interesting or important and explain why you feel a need to analyze it through a particular method.  You might lead in with a personal anecdote or description of the poem\u0026rsquo;s historical context. This can include quotation or discussion of what someone else wrote about the poem. Or, you might begin with an immersive, detailed description of the poem\u0026rsquo;s imagery or language. Regardless of approach, it is essential to eventually lead the reader to your thesis statement. This might entail creating a narrowing of focus, from general context to a more specific focus on the poem(s), or a widening of focus, from detailed description to questions of broader concern.   Demonstrate an explicit understanding of the term(s) you are working with and how you are using it. Are you using the term exactly as the original author intended it to be used, or are you modifying it slightly and taking it into a new context? Provide citations.  Close the introduction (first or second paragraph) with a question and/or a brief synopsis of the rest of your essay. If you do not use a question-answer approach, frame the thesis as a contrasting claim.  Q\u0026amp;A: How does this poem create such a vivid fictional world? Let us consider how its use of personal, spatial, and temporal deixis might furnish a response. C\u0026amp;A: While it may seem evident that this poem employs more ritual than fictive elements, I argue/show/explore how its fictive elements are indeed central to the poem\u0026rsquo;s expressive power.  (A \u0026ldquo;thesis\u0026rdquo; is a falsifiable statement. It is not obviously true, it may be downright provocative. It exists as the product of some kind of dialogue. That is why it is imperative to introduce it with a leading question or a counterclaim. You can imagine someone in the room talking to you, asking the question, demanding clarification, encouraging you to expand on what has been written. This is the organizational principle of essay writing.)\n The last paragraph should recapitulate what you discovered or discussed in the essay and then return to the original thesis statement. Did the essay sufficiently resolve the "tension" in your thesis? In what ways were the theoretical terms helpful for reading, interpreting, or gaining a better appreciation for the poem(s) you are writing about? In what ways were they insufficient?  Sequence the paragraphs in an intentional fashion. You might want to begin with an observation that seems easiest and move to the most difficult. You may work through a poem in chronological order. Regardless of approach, make sure it is clear how each new paragraph adds to or complicates what you have developed in the previous paragraphs. "Moreover" signals the former and "however" the latter. "First/Second/Third" signals a clear separation in ideas, which is helpful, but it can likewise reveal a lack of logical connections.  Provide vivid evidence of your claims by quoting directly and concisely from the text. Include block quotes where apt, i.e. to provide important context, or where you plan on engaging in prolonged commentary on the quote in question. Make decisions as to how detailed you want to be based on imagining your reader. Where might they need more assistance in seeing the detailed observations or thought processes behind your claims?  Sentences should be sequenced in a way that is clearly motivated and which propels the reader\'s interest forward. Use first-person language to steer your argument: "I will now shift focus to..."; "Now that we have defined "fictive utterance," let us see how..." Make use of prepositional phrases, imperatives, and questions to punctuate your prose.  By investigating how Poet uses Device, we can\u0026hellip; Notice how poet uses Device to orient the reader\u0026hellip; How does the poet\u0026rsquo;s use of Device relate to the meaning of\u0026hellip;?   Pay attention to sentence rhythm. Interweave short and long, simple and complex; use contrasts to your advantage. Avoid unwarranted, consecutive repetition of words and phrases (e.g. "this..." or "indeed"). A quick proofreading trick is to simply highlight every sentence with the cursor as you comb through your essay.  Pay attention to how you are using different parts of speech.  Use active verbs in the simple present. Here\u0026rsquo;s a syntax highlighter, use it! Check to see if you are overusing any verbal form of \u0026ldquo;be\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;have.\u0026rdquo; In many cases, these can be replaced by something more apt. Use prepositions/postpositions judiciously. Too much of \u0026ldquo;of\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;as\u0026rdquo; can obscure the meaning of a sentence. If you find a sentence with too many prepositions, replace some with a verb. Use concrete and suggestive nouns and adjectives. They may refer very directly and literally to what you are writing about, or describe that thing by way of metaphor. Define any terms you are using in an idiosyncratic or special way. Be especially aware of this if you find yourself repeating a word that does not come directly from the poem.   Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. This normally takes the form of Noun-Phrase + Prepositional-Phrase, e.g. "Ritual and Fiction in Rilke\'s New Poems." It can also be bipartite, separated by a colon into two lines: "You Must Change Your Life: The Use of Apostrophe in Rilke\'s New Poems"  Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the "Appendix" of your paper and cite line numbers from the Appendix. Tip: Use template on Canvas, especially for "An Octopus." You can just cite page numbers from "Self-Portrait of a Convex Mirror," or any other long poem.  If you incorporate secondary sources beyond what has been convered in class, make sure they are reputable, scholarly sources. Consult me for advice on where to find them or what sources to choose.  Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. If typing up meter, do it in a consistent style, following the guidelines from Essay 1.  The paper should be relatively free of typographical, spelling, and grammar errors. Check for verb agreement, extra/missing spaces and indents, and proper placement of punctuation near quotes.

You may want to use the Knight Institute Writing Center for additional help.\nLooking Ahead #  Like the previous essay, this prompt allows you to practice reading a poem using specific terms and methodologies inherited from another text. However, it is a bit more open-ended and should give you a better feel for what kind of methods you prefer to use in the final paper. This essay also opens the avenue for writing about groups or sequences of poems, and for incorporating a wider array of external resources.\n '}),a.add({id:12,href:'/docs/writing/3/',title:"Essay 3",section:"Writing",content:"Essay 3 - \u0026ldquo;Studium, Punctum\u0026rdquo; #  Due Friday, 11/29, at 22:00; revisions due by 12/1 at 22:00\nPrompt #  In Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes seeks to describe how photographs generate desire in him as a viewer, and comes up with two key terms, studium and punctum. Read his definition below:\n What I feel about these photographs derives from an average affect, almost from a certain training. I did not know a French word which might account for this kind of human interest, but I believe this word exists in Latin: it is studium, which doesn’t mean, at least not immediately, “study,” but application to a thing, taste for someone, a kind of general, enthusiastic commitment, of course, but without special acuity. It is by studium that I am interested in so many photographs, whether I receive them as political testimony or enjoy them as good historical scenes: for it is culturally (this connotation is present in studium) that I participate in the figures, the faces, the gestures, the settings, the actions.\n  The second element will break (or punctuate) the studium. This time it is not I who seek it out (as I invest the field of the studium with my sovereign consciousness), it is this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me. A Latin word exists to designate this wound, this prick, this mark made by a pointed instrument: the word suits me all the better in that it also refers to the notion of punctuation, and because the photographs I am speaking of are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds are so many points. This second element which will disturb the studium I shall therefore call punctum; for punctum is also: sting, speck, cut, little hole—and also a cast of the dice. A photograph’s punctum is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me). (25-27)\n [Refer to sections 10-24 in Camera Lucida for more.]\nFind a punctum in a poem of your choosing. It could be word, phrase, line, or sentence at a specific location in the poem. Then write about it. What is it about this punctum that “pricks” you? How does it stand out against the poem\u0026rsquo;s studium? The punctum might be your favorite point in the poem, or it might be the most troubling or confusing. Your description may lead you to discuss other parts of the poem, but make sure to circle back to the punctum at the end of your essay.\nFurther notes #   In order to describe the punctum you will need to discuss how it diverges from or is separate from the poem’s studium, or what might be called its “normative” language. Use your notes on the ritual and fictional elements of the poem, and/or on its lineation, meter, rhyme, conceits, and imagery as a guide for identifying such norms. Or, treat the poem like a photograph that corresponds to its place and time—do historical or biographical research on the poet or its subject matter, and try to describe exactly what was \u0026lsquo;seen\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;captured\u0026rsquo; through the poem. Keep in mind that it may take multiple readings and some time away from the poem in order to figure out what your punctum is. Reading the poem out loud is a necessity; it helps you slow down and notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. Transcribing by hand or keyboard is similarly helpful. Maybe you won\u0026rsquo;t find a single punctum, or will find it impossible to describe the punctum, or localize it. That\u0026rsquo;s fine—you could dedicate a large chunk of your essay to these difficulties. The analogy between photography and poetry is imperfect. Don\u0026rsquo;t take everything Barthes says as some kind of universal truth. For instance, you may not worry too much about the \u0026ldquo;unintentionality\u0026rdquo; of the punctum, since most poets often exercise more agency over what appears in their poems than most photographers do with their photographs. The punctum of a poem may be intentionally willed by the poet, but still remain striking and beautiful. You can write this as a story or a poem, in which case you may wish to use a modified citation format with footnotes/endnotes.  Specifications #   Begin with an immersive description of the 'world' of the poem. This may involve describing the poem itself, writing about what precedes your reading of the poem (personal knowledge or experience), or imagining the circumstances that led to its composition. This can take on the tone of a memoir, an academic study, or a story.  Pivot at the end of the first paragraph or the beginning of the second paragraph to a discussion of Barthes' terms 'punctum' and 'studium.' You should certainly define them (using citations) and discuss their context (that they were used to discuss photography)  The thesis statement should immediately follow the discussion of Barthes and provide a map of the essay, or a simple question. Since this is a short essay, it doesn't have to be very detailed. The main thing you are searching for is a way of locating or describing the 'punctum.'  In the subsequent paragraph(s), go into greater depth in your description of the poem's studium. This is a good place to introduce historical background, or to associate the imagery or subject matter of the poem with something external: cross-disciplinary or personal associations. Make sure you establish strong relationships between each paragraph. Are you presenting two antithetical ideas and then synthesizing them in the third? Progressively zooming in on one? Panning through three disjoint topics?  The penultimate paragraph should transition to the punctum, which in all likelihood will be an outlier observation that doesn't exactly fit into the narrative created in the previous paragraphs.  The concluding paragraph should reflect on whether or not that outlying idea really is the 'punctum'—did it help you understand why you are affected by the poem? Maybe it's not the real 'punctum,' or there are multiple. That's fine, just tell the reader.  The paragraph-by-paragraph structure of this essay is probably going to be: intro-definition-thesis, studium, studium, studium, punctum, reflection. With that basic structure set, focus on creating an immersive experience for the reader by concentrating on the construction of your sentences.  Search for vivid, concrete adjectives and nouns; active, precise verbs. Pay attention to variation in sentence length—punctuate long sentences with short ones, make sure long sentences are really necessary (usually they work best if they are lists, or use apposition instead of subordination).   Make sure the paper is relatively free of typographical, grammatical, and spelling errors. Remember to put periods and commas inside quotation marks!  Check with me to make sure external sources are reputable.  Give the paper an apt, memorable title.  Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing. The body of the paper should be around 3 pages. Submit to Canvas as a PDF.  Transcribe the poem with line numbers and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the \"Appendix\" of your paper, prior to the Works Cited page.  Submit a separate document in which you reflect on the experience of writing this. Compare it to your experience with the previous assignments. Which of the assignment felt most fulfilling to you and why? Are you getting a sense of which you might emulate or draw from in writing your final essay? Most importantly, what kind of feedback would you like to get on this paper? This should be about a page long.  Grading criteria #  The grading scheme follows that of Essay 4. It\u0026rsquo;s letter-based, based on my intuition as a reader than on your strict fulfillment of the above criteria. This is closer to how papers actually get graded in writing-based classes, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to get used to, even if it seems less objective.\nLooking Ahead #  Identifying a punctum can be a strong way of starting an essay and developing a focal question. Writing about the studium is a way of incorporating external research into this paper. The personal nature of the studium may also allow you to incorporate modes of writing that are more narrative or journalistic in nature. This essay will hopefully allow you to reflect on which theoretical methods you prefer to use, what poems you enjoy writing about, what challenges you are facing when doing external research, and how you relate to your subject matter.\n "}),a.add({id:13,href:'/docs/writing/4/',title:"Essay 4",section:"Writing",content:'Essay 4 - \u0026ldquo;Final\u0026rdquo; #  Due Friday, 12/10 at 22:00\nPrompt #  Design your own prompt or recycle one of the previous three.

The essay sequence is meant to guide you toward writing a final paper that is much more meaningful and surprising than anything you could have accomplished in isolation.\n Requirements #   Attendance and participation in class and online Two individual meetings with the instructor Timely completion of essay assignments  There will be five essays, four will be given a letter grade.\n Essay 0 – \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; – 1-2 pages (September 7) Essay 1 – \u0026ldquo;Line, Meter\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (September 25) Essay 2 – \u0026ldquo;Ritual, Fiction\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (October 16) Essay 3 – \u0026ldquo;Punctum\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (October 30) Essay 4 – \u0026ldquo;Final\u0026rdquo; – 8-12 pages (December 17)  The final version of each assignment prompt will be available at least one week in advance of the due date. Listed page counts are useful guidelines, but you may write more if it feels important to do so. Essays should follow MLA citation and style guidelines, with Times New Roman font and 1.7 line spacing.1 Turn in all papers as PDFs on Canvas. Submit a copy of the poem in the front matter of your paper (see template on Canvas). Separately attach a voice recording of you reading the poem. Your recitation is not going to be evaluated, but may be helpful for observing aspects of a poem that are not apparent through silent reading.\nCourse Materials #  All readings will be made available on Canvas or linked to the schedule at least a week in advance. If you are looking for a resource not on the syllabus that is unavailable at the library, let me know, and I will try to help.\nSince many poems are digitized and access to printing is limited, you must bring electronic devices to class for the sake of viewing PDFs or ebooks.\nYou are encouraged to purchase one or two books in hard copy, especially from Abebooks, Powell\u0026rsquo;s, or the local Buffalo Street Books. While electronic books have their benefits, the physical book encourages casual encounters with random pages and invites rereading.\nTablets are highly recommended for marking up texts and tend to be more conducive to focused reading.\nGrading #  The minimum expected grade, B- will be given to those who\n1. Miss no more than three classes*\n2. Participate in all class activities**\n3. Complete all essays on time***  Grades above this depend on quality of essay assignments. It will be difficult to do well on the writing assignments if you are not participating regularly. Essays 1-3 count for 20% each, Essay 4 counts for 40%. Essay 0 is purely diagnostic and not graded. See individual rubrics for each essay as they are released for exact grading criteria.\nNumerical scale: 98-100% (A+), 93-97% (A), 90-92% (A-), 88-89% (Β+), 83-87% (B), …\n* Being more than 15 minutes late to class counts as an absence. Being more than 5 minutes late three times counts as an absence. Absences beyond three will not negatively affect your grade if they are due to a medical emergency or quarantine mandate. Otherwise, each additional absence constitutes a 1% deduction from the final grade.\n** You can miss up to three slack discussion posts, but you must complete all Canvas discussion board posts. Slack posts should be in by 21:00 prior to class; Canvas discussion board posts should also be timely but you may post them as much as 24 hours late.\n*** The essay must show some attempt to respond to the prompt. I cannot give credit to essays turned in more than 24 hours late. If you need an extension, contact me and we\u0026rsquo;ll work something out. Otherwise, adhering to deadlines will help you deal with even more stringent deadlines in other classes and life situations, so it is important to start following them now.\nZoom #  If you need to access class online, reference the Canvas \u0026ldquo;Zoom\u0026rdquo; tab for access.

Didi Chang-Park (he)\ndp625@cornell.edu\nOffice Hours  COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS) #  Poems are puzzles, or are they plants? In this class, we will respond to key questions like \u0026ldquo;How does this poem work?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Why do I like it?\u0026rdquo; We will also grapple with the paradox of writing about poetry in a closed, concise form without domesticating it, by investigating how reading poetry can teach us how to write anew. How are lines and stanzas related to sentences and paragraphs? Can ideas \u0026ldquo;rhyme?\u0026rdquo; Are notions such as deixis, voice, metaphor, apostrophe, prosody, and the \u0026ldquo;lyric I\u0026rdquo; essential to producing a cogent and truthful argument in any discipline?\nLearning Outcomes #    This course is focused on developing skills for attentive reading. You will leave the course with a heightened sensitivity to line, meter, rhyme, and other linguistic forms in poetry. You will also learn how to describe the world or voice of a poem or poet through corpus-driven, historical, and/or biographical research. The former will strengthen your analytical skills, while the latter will challenge you to synthesize wide-ranging kinds of information.\n  Writing is revising, and the best revisions arise from collaborative efforts. You will learn to approach writing as a kind of dialogue with yourself, poems, poets, peers, scholars, and the world. The essay sequence is meant to guide you toward writing a final paper that is much more meaningful and surprising than anything you could have accomplished in isolation.\n  You will walk away from this course with a stronger sense of what you value and why you value it. What makes a particular poem (or topic, or song, or subject) more powerful than another one? To what extent is value dependent on personal preferences? How do these preferences come to be, and what effects do they have on the world of poetry?\n  Materials #  All readings will be made available on Canvas, linked to the schedule on this website, or uploaded to Slack. Please do not circulate slides, handouts, scans, or any other course materials online.\nYou are encouraged to read beyond the course materials. Use the library; use JSTOR, use HathiTrust and other databases. You can check out books from other libraries using BorrowDirect if they are currently unavailable at Cornell.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in buying books, check Abebooks and Powell\u0026rsquo;s for discount prices. Buffalo Street Books and Odyssey Bookstore are some local options with curbside pickup. While electronic books have their benefits, physical books enable casual encounters with random pages and invite rereading. Tablets are also recommended for marking up texts.\nFWS Requirements #  There will be five essays, 1-4 will be given a letter grade.\nEssay 0 – \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; – 1-2 pages (February 12) Essay 1 – \u0026ldquo;Rhyme, Line, Meter\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (March 6)\nEssay 2 – \u0026ldquo;Responding\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (April 3) Essay 3 – \u0026ldquo;Punctum\u0026rdquo; – 3-5 pages (April 23)\nEssay 4 – \u0026ldquo;Final\u0026rdquo; – 8-12 pages (May 19)\nEssays 1-3 count for 20% each, Essay 4 counts for 40%. See individual rubrics for each essay as they are released for exact grading criteria. Essays 1-3 may be revised multiple times up to a week after feedback is received; Essay 4 will go through a drafting process, but may not be revised after feedback is released. It is possible to earn an A+ in this class if and only if you receive an A+ on Essay 4. I may nominate up to two students per term to submit work to one of the Knight Institute\u0026rsquo;s FWS prizes.\nPlease follow MLA citation and style guidelines, with Times New Roman font. Be sure to put commas and periods inside quotation marks: \u0026ldquo;Hello,\u0026rdquo; he said / She said \u0026ldquo;hello.\u0026rdquo; There is one special rule for this class: use 1.7 line spacing, not the typical double-spacing.1\nParticipation #  We use Slack to share brief responses to poems and prompts prior to (and sometimes in) class. The quality and consistency of your output on these assignments is strongly correlated with your performance on the essays, but does not directly contribute to your grade.\nCanvas discussion board posts and peer review exchanges are essential and cannot be missed. You can submit them a bit late if need be, without any penalty, but a missed assignment will lead to an A- cap on your final grade.\nIf you miss class, send an email letting me know. You may miss up to 3 classes for any reason before your grade is capped at an A-. Missing more than six classes leads to a B+ maximum, more than nine leads to a B, etc. Arriving more than 10 minutes late three times counts as an absence. Sleeping in class will lead to a concerned email and counts as two absences, since it can be distracting to others. Please get enough sleep!\nTry to speak up during every discussion, or at very least once a week. If you\u0026rsquo;re naturally shy or have difficulty participating in impromptu discussions, send me an email with a comment or question after class. Grades are capped at an A- for students who rarely participate in or outside of class.\nParticipation-related grading caps are cumulative, so if you have missed four classes and rarely participated in class throughout the term, your grade would be capped at a B+. I will let you know how you are doing with participation (Slack, DB posts, peer review, attendance, discussions) when returning feedback for Essays 1, 2, and 3.\nGrading #  The final grade is calculated by taking the weighted average of the four essay grades and subtracting any participation-related penalties.\nZoom #  If you need to access class online, reference the Canvas \u0026ldquo;Zoom\u0026rdquo; tab for access.

Focus on Roastbeef in Tender Buttons, explore whatever else catches your eye. Mullen\'s S*PeRM**K*T directly corresponds to Stein\'s \u0026ldquo;Food\u0026rdquo; section of Tender Buttons. How does it differentiate itself from its source of inspiration? 9/11: Francis Ponge, \u0026ldquo;The Carnation\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;L\u0026rsquo;œillet\u0026rdquo;), excerpts from Unfinished Ode to Mud, Andrew Epstein,\u0026ldquo;The Rhapsody of Things as They Are\u0026rdquo;\nLet\'s try to identify specific rhetorical patterns, techniques, and tropes in Ponge\u0026rsquo;s writing which we might employ in our own. Discussion Board Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you\'ve had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a "template text" to roughly define its length.\n Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, or write a "scrambled" set of poems that use similar phrases in different order.  Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English. Try to use registers of speech or "found linguistic materials" (like stuff from a COVID-related news report?)...  Stein: Write something highly repetitive and rhythmic, using words that sonically bring to mind the object in question without denoting it directly.  Fourth option: don\'t copy any of the poets consciously, just write about an object. Then add a paragraph of commentary afterwards on how you feel your poetics relates to the past week\'s poets—are you doing something completely different? Are there any similarities?  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet\'s style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.      Week 3: Sept 14, 16, 18 – Line and Meter #   Primary Forms  ↕  9/14: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from A Little Book on Form\nPrior to class, put in the #line slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further). Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it \u0026ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making\u0026rdquo;?  9/16: Whitman, \u0026ldquo;Song of Myself\u0026rdquo;; Hass: \u0026ldquo;A Note on Stress,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How to Scan a Poem\u0026rdquo;\nPrior to class, keep a list of favorite lines from Whitman, adding to the #whitman channel one excerpt that you are particularly drawn to, with or without commentary by Tuesday at 22:00. You might want to scan it and discuss what you find. Also put one excerpt from the Hass reading in the #meter channel by Tuesday night. 9/18: Whitman cont., A.R. Ammons: Corsons Inlet; Hass: \u0026ldquo;How Free Verse Works\u0026rdquo;\n Prior to class, make a post in the #freeverse channel. Comment on how line groupings and/or meter function in some excerpt of A.R. Ammons\'s "Corsons Inlet" or Robert Hass\'s "Meditation at Lagunitas" relate to your more immediate reaction to the poem\'s expression. Post by Thursday @ 22:00. Earlier is better!  After class, start looking at the Sonnet reader and begin drafting your discussion board post, which is essentially a draft or proposal for Essay 1, "Line."  Discussion Board Pick a poem to write about for Essay 1 (Links to an external site.). I suggest you choose any of the poems we\'ve read so far, especially one you\'ve written a comment on, or any sonnet* from the Sonnet Reader (117-sonnets.pdf). As with all future assignments, you\'re free to find something else on your own.\nFirst write about what you notice, with regards to the meaning or expressive effects of the poem. Then scan it and look for stanzas or line groupings** that stand out to you. Comment on any interesting patterns you find and try to connect these observations with your earlier observations on meaning/expression. Finally, ask a question or make a comment on how your post could be further developed. Post by Sunday at 22:00.\n*If you want to write on a sonnet that\'s not originally in English, you may want to focus on line groupings, or otherwise do a bit of research on how that language is supposed to be scanned. **If you\'re dealing with a poem that has no obvious 1/2/3/4-line divisions or metrical pattern (i.e. Corsons Inlet) you should still try to identify the "ghosts" of these structures. Remember that trying to impose a rule or structure on a poem and then failing will help you see precisely where and how it exceeds those boundaries/expectations. Merely stating that a poem does not fit into categories is not enough to make this truth sufficiently vivid. You can be candid about the fact that an experiment or methodology is not the best fit for a poem in your writing, and choose not to use it at all in future essays, but for the purposes of this upcoming essay I\'d like you to try your best to use "meter" and "line" as analytical categories.      Essay 1 \u0026ldquo;Line\u0026rdquo; (Due 9/25, 22:00)\nRevisions, if needed, are due on October 7.\nWeek 4: Sept 21, 23, 25 – Sonnet #   Collecting Sonnets ↕  We will take an \u0026ldquo;inductive\u0026rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile? A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas (  Files  Sonnet  129-sonnets.pdf ). 9/21: Essay 1 Discussion, Sonnet reader\nBefore class, take a look at the sonnets in the reader. Choose a sonnet to share in the #sonnet channel. You may give general impressions and write about its meter, rhyme, or line groupings. In class we\'ll talk about the discussion board posts and upcoming essay, and then talk about some of your chosen sonnets. 9/23: Sonnet reader (cont.)\nPlease post to #sonnet prior to class. If you have already posted a sonnet, post another one. We\'ll continue talking about sonnets today, identifying common topics, trends in historical development, and variations in form (rhyme, cross-linguistic meter, length, stanza structure). We\'ll also do some reading exercises with the short essays from Art of the Sonnet to practice extracting key ideas quickly from secondary texts. 9/25: Sonnet reader (cont.) Art of the Sonnet, Introduction (p. 5-25)\nPrior to class, focus on finishing Essay 1. If you have time, read the introduction of Art of the Sonnet and peruse some of the short essays on individual sonnets. When you\'re done, read the given page range of Post-Petrarchism for Monday. In class, we will try to consolidate some of the observations we made in class on Wednesday with a lecture on the Early Modern sonnet and the function of the poetic conceit.    Week 5: Sept 28, 30, Oct 2 – Sonnet #   Sonnets: Ritual, Fiction ↕  9/28: Sonnet reader (cont.) Post-Petrarchism, Introduction (p. 1-13)\nPrior to class, read and take your own notes on ritual and fiction dimensions of a sonnet from the reader. We will discuss sonnets from the 19th century onward see how we can apply these concepts to various poems. We will also develop an understanding of how our previous discussions of line, meter, and conceit, relate to the two new terms.\nOptional reading: "On the Margins of Discourse" by Barbara Herrnstein Smith. This is referenced in the definition of "fiction" in Greene\'s book and is a very clear, interesting read. 9/30: Sonnet reader (cont.), Post-Petrarchism, Chapter 1 (p. 22-27)\nChoose a sonnet and think about how it uses deixis in an interesting manner. Bring your thoughts to class. We will see how we can apply deixis to various sonnets, and our focus will move beyond the individual poem to poems in sequences or groups. 10/2: Sonnet reader (cont.), Theory of the Lyric, Chapter 1 (p. 10-38)\nPay close attention to how the nine poems presented in the chapter are analyzed. Prior to class, choose a sonnet (or other poem); write a sentence or two in #post-petrarchism on how it involves deixis, ritual and fiction, and/or the four parameters (enunciative-apparatus, being-event, re-performance, hyperbolic-risk). Please do this by 21:00.    Week 6: Oct 5, Oct 7, Oct 9 – Ode #   Ashbery\u0026#43;Moore ↕  This week we pay closer attention to notions like "voice," "address," and "dialogue" in order to better understand these longer poems work. We will also continue to apply the concepts encountered last week: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, and ask ourselves which of these terms seem most helpful. Oct 5 - John Ashbery, \u0026ldquo;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror\u0026rdquo;\n Read p. 68-76 of the Ashbery poem.  Then write a comment in #ashbery on a segment of the poem which felt particularly vivid, present, or clear to you and one which felt vague, abstract, or confusing. Does identifying deictics or finding instances of the four parameters at work change your understanding of that segment? Do this by 21:00 on Sunday.  Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you\'re having trouble with Ashbery.  You may also want to refer to the Parmigianino painting referred to in the poem\'s title. Oct 7 - Ashbery cont., Marianne Moore, \u0026ldquo;An Octopus\u0026rdquo;\n Read the rest of "Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror" (76-83).  Begin reading "An Octopus." Add to #moore an excerpt from the poem that stands out to you as either especially compelling or especially confusing; connect it to one of the terms we\'ve covered last week.  In class, we\'ll continue talking about our affective responses to different parts of the poems and how the various terms covered last week can help us better understand these responses.  Some clarifications on the nature of the "ode" will be addressed today.  Oct 9 - Marianne Moore, \u0026ldquo;An Octopus\u0026rdquo;, T.S. Eliot, \u0026ldquo;The Three Voices of Poetry\u0026rdquo;\n Finish "An Octopus."  Read the Eliot essay.  Read the markup guide, and apply it to a page of "The Three Voices." Post that page to #rhetoric with a few comments on what you found.  In class we\'ll see if you can identify instances of the first, second, and/or third voices in either Ashbery or Moore. During class, add to #three-voices a quote from the Eliot essay alongside a segment from either of the poems where you feel one of the three voices is particularly salient. Discussion Board Start Essay 2. Focus on determining which term(s) you\'d like to focus on and what type of essay you\'d like to write: will you write about one poem in detail, or write about how multiple poems relate to any of the recently encountered concepts? Post the first two paragraphs; write them as if you were about to turn them in. Please do this by 21:00 on Sunday so I have time to look over them before class.   Essay 2 “Ritual, Fiction” (Due 10/16, 22:00)\nRevisions, if needed, are due on October 28.\n   Week 7: Oct 12, 16 – Essays on Ashbery + Moore #   Rhetoric ↕  In preparation for Essay 2, we\'ll work through some essays on the poems we read last week, or on the theoretical texts we previously read, searching for rhetorical strategies, argumentative structures, and sentence forms that we can use in our own writing. Oct 12 - Ashbery + Moore\nPick one of the following articles to read and mark up. Reivew the markup guide for some directions on what to look for and how to do this. This time, focus on writing comments on sentence-to-sentence transitions within a paragraph, or broader commentary on the sequencing of paragraphs. Post to #rhetoric.

Nov 6 - Politics in the Poem\nWe will take a look at several post-9/11 poems and discuss the role of politics in the poem. Does political language change how you engage with poetry? Is it an impediment or a site of attraction for you? Poems include Robert Hass\'s "Dancing," Hayan Charara\'s "Usage," excerpts from Claudia Rankine\'s Citizen, and a sonnet from Ben Lerner\'s The Lichtenberg Figures. Week 11: Nov 9, 11, 13 — Politics \u0026amp; Science #  We will discuss the relationship between certain complex topics, political and scientific, and poetry\'s "value." Are all poems political? What is politics? What does scientific language bring to the poem? How does your reaction to specific poems, their forms, and their topics relate to your own values as a reader and writer?

Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations #  Individual Conference III\n(Schedule between 11/30 and 12/11)\nGuidelines Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:\n Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion. Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better. During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.  Here are some suggestions for what to present:\n Poem-centric: Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing. Essay-centric: Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications. Idea-centric: Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you\u0026rsquo;d like to include. Class-centric: Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you\u0026rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the last presenters.  These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.\n  Nov 30: One, Two, Three\nDec 2: Four, Five\nDec 4: Six, Seven\nWeek 15: Dec 7, 9, 11 — Presentations #  Dec 7: Eight, Nine\nDec 9: Ten, Eleven\nDec 11: Twelve, Thirteen\nWeek 16: Dec 14, 16 — Presentations #  Dec 14: Fourteen, Fifteen\nDec 16: Sixteen, Seventeen\nEssay 4 “Final” (Due 12/17, 22:00)\nCourse-Teacher Evaluations due (online)\nFinal exam period runs from December 17-20.   var tooltipSpan = document.getElementsByClassName("tooltip-reveal"); window.onmousemove = function(e) { var x = e.clientX, y = e.clientY; for (var i = 0; i '})})()
