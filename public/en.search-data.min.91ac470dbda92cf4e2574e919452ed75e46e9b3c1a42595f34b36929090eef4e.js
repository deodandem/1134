The artifice and extremity of poetic language gives rise to various insights about how language works and what its capacities are more generally.\nOur focus on \u0026ldquo;lyric poetry\u0026rdquo; means that you will be encouraged to read poems closely and repeatedly. Repeated reading is closely aligned with the goal of becoming comfortable with re-reading and revising your own work, which is necessary to becoming a strong writer and an empathetic, astute listener.\nPoems can and do cover pretty much every topic under the sun, so everyone should be able to find some poem or poet who effectively engages with any of your interests. As a freshman, one of your main goals this year is to figure out what to major in, and I hope this course will guide you in that process by giving you the latitude to seek out poems that bring you closer to your personal ambitions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to read poetry alone, and to find time for reading anything in this careful and iterative sense. Taking a writing course on reading poetry will provide a special framework for engaging with something that is important and powerful but difficult to access.\n(2) Do I like the readings? #  University classes are ideally fun and interesting, but are not primarily designed to entertain. Learning is often difficult and cause for discomfort. Sometimes we will read things that are totally mystifying, which were written in older versions of the English language and that are therefore a bit difficult to get into. Many poems take time and repeated readings to become attuned to, but you may find that some are simply not for you. One of the best experiences you can have is to learn to appreciate something you didn\u0026rsquo;t like before, or to see a new aspect of something you do already enjoy.1 However, we write and think best when we\u0026rsquo;re glad to spend time with our thoughts and whatever it is that we are studying. If you\u0026rsquo;re having concerns about not liking the readings for this course, here are a few things you might do:\n Write about your alienation or distaste for a text. Reach out to me and let me know about your concerns. Ask a peer about their own reactions to readings, see if you can get a person who is a fan of a text to explain why they like it. Find poems you do like and try to understand why. Read the text multiple times. Try to understand why it was written. Try to understand a text in terms of its impact on other writers.  Ideally you should ideally use a combination of these tactics to help you find value in texts that are difficult to appreciate. Never feel bad about your reactions to texts, but be careful not to dismiss something too loudly or quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting to hear about others\u0026rsquo; responses before coming to a more final judgment.\n(3) What am I enjoying most? #  This is a critical question, as it should be the main heuristic for choosing what to write about. The question of taste might be broken down into three components:\n(1) What poems am I enjoying?\nI encourage you to write your final paper on a poem or set of poems that you really like and want to spend time reading and thinking about. Keep in mind that the more you read with care and openness to others' perspectives, the more likely it is that you will develop a heightened appreciation of whatever poems you end up preferring, which will in turn make the final essay experience more meaningful. (2) What exercises, discussions, and ideas am I drawn to?\nKeeping this question in mind will help you develop a method, a research question, and a more specific analytical toolkit for approaching the poem(s) you love. Often people express a fear that analyzing a work of art will \"deaden\" it. You should be on the lookout for methodologies that heighten your appreciation of and interest in your topic. (3) What aspects of writing do I feel best about?\nWriting can be a fearsome and paralyzing process. Knowing what you value in writing will help you begin and sustain any complex effort. When you read over your drafts, ask yourself what is going well before jumping to self-criticism. I tend to provide feedback that highlights and amplifies strong points in your writing. Make changes in service of your strengths, not merely to \"correct\" a perceived weakness. (4) What\u0026rsquo;s my role in this class? #  This is a class, not an independent study! We\u0026rsquo;re here to learn from each other, and participate in a poetry-reading and writing community. Going to class and entering group discussions should not feel totally separate from whatever thoughts you may be having inside your own head. Writing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a private process.\nWhile the instructor may be the primary leader of the course, he is not the sole arbiter of ideas. Everyone has views that matter, and everyone is capable of leading discussions and presenting their ideas.\nThis is for you to answer. I suspect the responses will vary quite a bit. You might ask yourself some sub-questions, such as, \u0026ldquo;What makes the study of poetry compelling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How is poetry \u0026ldquo;useful\u0026rdquo; in other domains of knowledge and innovation?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s my relationship to poetry?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What kinds of writing do you want to produce in the future?\u0026rdquo;\n Notes #  [1] \u0026quot;Acquired tastes and the pleasures of imitation\u0026quot; by William Flesch ↩\n There\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure in the experience of conversion. Wittgenstein writes (of psychoanalysis) that when we are disinclined to accept something, we are also inclined to accept it. Why? Not because disinclination is repression of desire, but because desire comes from the overcoming of disinclination. The pleasure is one of discovery and novelty, if not in the object (how boring Clarissa is!) then in the self (how riveting it is!). We don\u0026rsquo;t see differently, but we alter our relation to seeing. That\u0026rsquo;s a second order experience worth having.\n  Second-order? Even on the receptive side, art is the experience of imitation, and imitation (cf. Roger Caillois, who argues that seeing itself is a mode of imitation, an assimilation of the sole to the visual field it projects itself into)—imitation is the most basic experience of experience that there is, and the most aesthetically intense. Acquired taste is as basic and as intense as it gets.\n "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/updates/assignment-0/','title':"Assignment 0",'section':"Updates",'content':"Prompt #  Consider the following passages from Octavio Paz’s essay “Poetry and Poem”:\n Poetry is knowledge, salvation, power, abandonment. An operation capable of changing the world, poetic activity is revolutionary by nature; a spiritual exercise, it is a means of interior liberation. Poetry reveals this world; it creates another. Bread of the chosen; accursed food. It isolates; it unites. Invitation to the journey; return to the homeland. Inspiration, respiration, muscular exercise. Prayer to the void, dialogue with absence: tedium, anguish, and despair nourish it. Prayer, litany, epiphany, presence. Exorcism, conjuration, magic. Sublimation, compensation, condensation of the unconscious. Historic expression of races, nations, classes. It denies history: at its core all objective conflicts are resolved and man at last acquires consciousness of being something more than a transient. Experience, feeling, emotion, intuition, undirected thought. Result of chance; fruit of calculation. Art of speaking in a superior way; primitive language. Obedience to rules; creation of others. Imitation of the ancients, copy of the real, copy of a copy of the Idea. Madness, ecstasy, logos. Return to childhood, coitus, nostalgia for paradise, for hell, for limbo. Play, work, ascetic activity. Confession. Innate experience. Vision, music, symbol. Analogy: the poem is a shell that echoes the music of the world, and meters and rhymes are merely correspondences, echoes, of the universal harmony. Teaching, morality, example, revelation, dance, dialogue, monologue. Voice of the people, language of the chosen, word of the solitary. Pure and impure, sacred and damned, popular and of the minority, collective and personal, naked and clothed, spoken, painted, written, it shows every face but there are those who say that it has no face: the poem is a mask that hides the void—a beautiful proof of the superfluous grandeur of every human work!\n  When we question the poem about the existence of poetry, are we not arbitrarily confusing poetry and poem? Aristotle said that “there is nothing in common, except metrics, between Homer and Empedocles; and thus the former is rightly called a poet and the latter a physiologist.” And so it is: not every poem—or to be exact: not every work constructed according to the laws of meter—contains poetry. But are those metrical works real poems or artistic, didactic, or rhetorical artifacts? A sonnet is not a poem, but a literary form, except when that rhetorical mechanism—stanzas, meters, and rhymes—has been touched by poetry. There are machines for rhyming but not for poetizing. There is also poetry without poems; landscapes, persons, and events are often poetic: they are poetry without being poems. Now, when poetry is given as a condensation of chance or when it is a crystallization of powers and circumstances alien to the poet’s creative will, we are in the presence of the poetic. When—active or passive, awake or sleeping—the poet is the wire that conducts and transforms the poetic current, we face something radically different: a work. A poem is a work. Poetry is polarized, assembled, and isolated in a human product: painting, song, tragedy. The poetic is poetry in an amorphous state; the poem is creation, poetry standing erect. Poetry is isolated and revealed completely only in the poem. It is licit to question the poem about the existence of poetry if one ceases to conceive the poem as a form capable of being filled with any content. The poem is not a literary form but the meeting place between poetry and man. A poem is a verbal organism that contains, stimulates, or emits poetry. The form and the substance are the same.”\n [The full essay is on Canvas for your reference, under Week 0]\nTask #  Let’s say that you get a chance to write an email to an alien who has never been to Earth. The alien has been assiduously studying English by reading the internet and digitized books, but doesn’t have experience with our world, has never been in dialogue with a human. The alien is thus having trouble understanding the word “poetic,” which is used to describe an extremely wide variety of phenomena with some sort of superlative attitude. Choose a personally meaningful work of art or experience and write about how it represents, for you, the “poetic.”\nFurther instructions #  Be sure to distinguish between the terms “poem,” “poetry,” and “poetic” in relation to the object. You may quote Paz in your essay to help clarify what you mean by these terms, but you should also feel free to make modifications on his ideas or provide your own definitions for these terms. Since you are describing this object to an alien, be sure to describe its basic characteristics: what it is made of, how it works, what its general purpose is, how you relate to it. Limit the scope of your description for this ~1000 word message by pointing out just a few specific traits of the object to substantiate your definition of the “poetic.” You may want to create a list of poetic traits for the alien, and then provide a detailed analysis of just one of these traits’ relationship to poetry.\nLooking Ahead #  We are going to be focusing on poems for much of this course, with the assumption that poems are a specifically linguistic form of poetry. This assignment gives you an opportunity to think about what poetry means for you outside of the linguistic sphere, and even outside of traditionally conceived “aesthetic experience.” Reflecting on what the poetic means to you will help guide you in future decisions in this course and beyond, in terms of what you choose to write about or study. This essay also invokes the same skills necessary for close engagement with poems in a scholarly/analytical context—close attention to detail, and the intent to clearly define and apply certain terms, often in conversation with another writer’s discussion of the same or related terminologies. It therefore provides an initial record of your aptitude for essay-writing.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/resources/','title':"Resources",'section':"Docs",'content':"Resources #  Citation: https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation\nWebsites:\n Poetry Foundation ubuweb Pennsound  Anthologies:\n Norton Anthology of Poetry The Making of a Sonnet, ed.
