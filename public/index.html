<p>Poems are puzzles, or are they plants? In this class, we will respond to key questions like &ldquo;How does this poem work?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why do I like it?&rdquo; Poems are often thought of as infinite in the possibilities of perception and wonder they produce. We will grapple with the paradox of writing about poetry in a closed, concise form without domesticating it, by investigating how reading poetry can teach us how to write anew. How are lines and stanzas related to sentences and paragraphs? Can ideas &ldquo;rhyme?&rdquo; Are notions such as deixis, voice, metaphor, apostrophe, prosody, and the &ldquo;lyric I&rdquo; essential to producing a cogent and truthful argument in any discipline?</p>

<p>This course is focused on developing skills for reading poetry in a close and systematic fashion. We will be covering annotation methods and exercises that can be used to discover the structures, patterns, meaning, and linguistic innovation present in poems. These “empirical” techniques are relevant to any kind observation, field work, note-taking, or imaginative endeavor necessary to success in other fields of inquiry.</p>
<h3 id="theory">
  Theory
  <a class="anchor" href="#theory">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Humans have developed a diverse range of terms used to point out and describe phenomena in poetic language. We will be learning to use some of these terms as tools. One broad question we will discuss is the definition of “lyric poetry,” and its relationship to the “ritual” and the “fictional.” This will in turn lead us to accumulate knowledge of various tropes and genres. Such an outcome is mainly useful to those of you planning on studying poetry beyond this course, so we will determine its weight based on student interest.</p>
<h3 id="invention">
  Invention
  <a class="anchor" href="#invention">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We will regularly work on transforming the thoughts, ideas, and discussions we have in class into writing; these are artifacts will give you a sense of how your ideas have developed over time and provide a foothold for improving your sensitivity to and appreciation of class materials and external phenomena. Moreover, you will learn to make writing into an active, social phenomenon, in which you are in conversation with yourself, poetry, your peers, and other scholars. The essay assignments in this class are meant to guide you to writing a final paper that feels genuine and valuable to your life.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="requirements">
  Requirements
  <a class="anchor" href="#requirements">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attendance and participation in class and online
<li>Two individual meetings with the instructor
<li>Timely completion of essay assignments
</ul>
<p>There will be five essays, four will be given a letter grade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Essay 0 — &ldquo;Diagnostic&rdquo; — 2 pages (September 7)</li>
<li>Essay 1 — &ldquo;Line&rdquo; — 3 pages (September 21)</li>
<li>Essay 2 — &ldquo;Ritual vs. Fiction&rdquo; - 4 pages (October 5)</li>
<li>Essay 3 — &ldquo;Punctum&rdquo; 4 pages (October 26)</li>
<li>Essay 4 — &ldquo;Question&rdquo; - 4 pages (November 16)</li>
<li>Essay 5 - &ldquo;Final&rdquo; 8-12 pages (December 15)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assignment prompt will be released at least one week in advance of the due date. Listed page counts are useful guidelines, but you may write more if it feels important to do so.
Essays should follow <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html">MLA citation and style guidelines,</a> with Times New Roman font and 1.5 line spacing. Turn in all papers as PDFs on Canvas. Submit a copy of the poem in the front matter of your paper (see template on Canvas). Separately attach a voice recording of you reading the poem. Your recitation is not going to be evaluated, but it is a useful enough practice to warrant official submission and may be helpful for observing aspects of a poem that are not apparent through silent reading.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">
  Course Materials
  <a class="anchor" href="#course-materials">#</a>
</h2>
<p>All course materials will be available on Canvas.</p>
<p>Since many poems are digitized and access to printing is limited, you are encouraged to bring electronic devices to class for the sake of viewing PDFs or ebooks, and for doing in-class writing activities. It is perfectly acceptable to do everything with pen and paper, but only if you are able to transcribe or print readings.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to purchase one or two books in hard copy, especially from Abebooks, Powell&rsquo;s, or the local Buffalo Street Books. It&rsquo;s easier to flip to a random page of a book and keep it around as a physical invitation to re-read and reference it.</p>
<p>Tablets are very useful for marking up texts and tend to be less distracting than using a PDF viewer on a computer to read from.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
  Grading
  <a class="anchor" href="#grading">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The minimum expected grade, B- will be given to those who</p>
<ol>
<li>Miss no more than three classes*</li>
<li>Participate in all class activities</li>
<li>Complete all assignments on time**</li>
</ol>
<p>Grades above this depend on quality of essay assignments. Essays 1-4 count for 15% each, Essay 5 counts for 40%. Essay 0 is purely diagnostic and not graded. See individual rubrics for each essay as they are released for exact grading criteria.</p>
<p>Numerical scale: 98-100% (A+), 93-97% (A), 90-92% (A-), 88-89% (Β+), 83-87% (B), …</p>
<p>* Being more than 15 minutes late to class counts as an absence. Being more than 5 minutes late three times counts as an absence. Absences beyond three will not negatively affect your grade if they are due to a medical emergency or quarantine mandate.</p>
<p>** Essays must respond to the prompt to receive credit. I cannot give credit for essays turned in more than 48 hours late, with the exception of Essay 5, for which you may request a personalized due date. Adhering to deadlines will help you deal with even more stringent deadlines in other classes and life situations.</p>
