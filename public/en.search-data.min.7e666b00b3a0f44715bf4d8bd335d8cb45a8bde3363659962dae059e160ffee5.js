How might the lines be grouped? How does the lineation relate to the motion of thought represented in the poem? Discussion Board Share the poem you will be writing about for Essay 1. First write about what you notice (this does not have to be about the lineation of the poem). Then share a quote from the Hass reading you'd like to reference in the essay. You do not have to make an argument about how that quote on lineation relates to what you noticed (that's for you to elaborate in the essay).

Classes resume online on 11/30.  Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations #  Guidelines Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:\n Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion. Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better. During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.  Here are some suggestions for what to present:\n Poem-centric: Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing. Essay-centric: Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications. Idea-centric: Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you\u0026rsquo;d like to include. Class-centric: Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you\u0026rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the last presenters.  These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.\n  Nov 30: One, Two\nDec 2: Three, Four\nDec 4: Five, Six\nWeek 15: Dec 7, 9, 11 — Presentations #  Dec 7: Seven, Eight, Nine\nDec 9: Ten, Eleven\nDec 11: Twelve, Thirteen\nWeek 16: Dec 14, 16 — Presentations #  Dec 14: Fourteen, Fifteen\nDec 16: Sixteen, Seventeen\nEssay 4 “Final” (Due 12/17, 22:00)\nCourse-Teacher Evaluations due (online)\nFinal exam period runs from December 17-20.   var tooltipSpan = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tooltip-reveal\"); window.onmousemove = function(e) { var x = e.clientX, y = e.clientY; for (var i = 0; i   Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The Lyric Theory Reader \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/writing/','title':"Writing",'section':"Docs",'content':"Essay Horizon #  The essay sequence is designed to lead you to a final paper.\nYou may use a combination of prompts 0-3 to design the fourth.\nHere are some questions that may help you locate your interests:  What expectations do I have about a poem?

Learning is often difficult and cause for discomfort. Sometimes we will read things that are totally mystifying, which were written in older versions of the English language and that are therefore a bit difficult to get into. Many poems take time and repeated readings to become attuned to, but you may find that some are simply not for you. One of the best experiences you can have is to learn to appreciate something you didn\u0026rsquo;t like before, or to see a new aspect of something you do already enjoy.1 However, we write and think best when we\u0026rsquo;re glad to spend time with our thoughts and whatever it is that we are studying. If you\u0026rsquo;re having concerns about not liking the readings for this course, here are a few things you might do:\n Write about your alienation or distaste for a text. Reach out to me and let me know about your concerns. Ask a peer about their own reactions to readings, see if you can get a person who is a fan of a text to explain why they like it. Find poems you do like and try to understand why. Read the text multiple times. Try to understand why it was written. Try to understand a text in terms of its impact on other writers.   Ideally you should ideally use a combination of these tactics to help you find value in texts that are difficult to appreciate. Never feel bad about your reactions to texts, but be careful not to dismiss something too loudly or quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting to hear about others\u0026rsquo; responses before coming to a more final judgment.\nWhat am I enjoying most? #  This is a critical question, as it should be the main heuristic for choosing what to write about. The question of taste might be broken down into three components:\n(1) What poems am I enjoying?\nI encourage you to write your final paper on a poem or set of poems that you really like and want to spend time reading and thinking about. Keep in mind that the more you read with care and openness to others' perspectives, the more likely it is that you will develop a heightened appreciation of whatever poems you end up preferring, which will in turn make the final essay experience more meaningful. (2) What exercises, discussions, and ideas am I drawn to?\nKeeping this question in mind will help you develop a method, a research question, and a more specific analytical toolkit for approaching the poem(s) you love. Often people express a fear that analyzing a work of art will \"deaden\" it. You should be on the lookout for methodologies that heighten your appreciation of and interest in your topic. (3) What aspects of writing do I feel best about?\nWriting can be a fearsome and paralyzing process. Knowing what you value in writing will help you begin and sustain any complex effort. When you read over your drafts, ask yourself what is going well before jumping to self-criticism. I tend to provide feedback that highlights and amplifies strong points in your writing. Make changes in service of your strengths, not merely to \"correct\" a perceived weakness. (3) What\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this class? #  Our focus on \u0026ldquo;lyric poetry\u0026rdquo; means that you will be encouraged to read poems closely and repeatedly. Repeated reading is closely aligned with the goal of becoming comfortable with re-reading and revising your own work, which is necessary to becoming a strong writer and an empathetic, astute listener.\nPoetry is a particularly keen source of knowledge and pleasure for writers. The artifice and extremity of poetic language helps produce insights about how language works and what its capacities are more generally.\nPoems can and do cover pretty much every topic under the sun. Everyone should be able to find some poem or poet who effectively engages with extra-poetic interests. As a freshman, one of your main goals this year is to figure out what to major in, and I hope this course will guide you in that process by giving you the latitude to seek out poems that bring you closer to your personal ambitions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to read poetry alone, and to find time for reading anything in this careful and iterative sense. Taking a writing course on reading poetry will provide a special framework for engaging with something that is important and powerful but difficult to access.\n(4) What\u0026rsquo;s my role in this class? #  We\u0026rsquo;re here to learn from each other, and participate in a poetry-reading and writing community. Going to class and entering group discussions should not feel totally separate from whatever thoughts you may be having inside your own head. Writing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a private process.\nThe specifics of your role in this community are for you to determine. You might ask yourself some sub-questions, such as, \u0026ldquo;What makes the study of poetry compelling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How is poetry \u0026ldquo;useful\u0026rdquo; in other domains of knowledge and innovation?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s my relationship to poetry?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What kinds of writing do you want to produce in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the instructor may be the primary leader of the course, he is not the sole arbiter of ideas. Everyone has views that are unique and interesting; everyone is capable of leading discussions and influencing the direction of the course.\n Notes #  [1] \u0026quot;Acquired tastes and the pleasures of imitation\u0026quot; by William Flesch ↩\n There\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure in the experience of conversion. Wittgenstein writes (of psychoanalysis) that when we are disinclined to accept something, we are also inclined to accept it. Why? Not because disinclination is repression of desire, but because desire comes from the overcoming of disinclination. The pleasure is one of discovery and novelty, if not in the object (how boring Clarissa is!) then in the self (how riveting it is!). We don\u0026rsquo;t see differently, but we alter our relation to seeing. That\u0026rsquo;s a second order experience worth having.\n  Second-order? Even on the receptive side, art is the experience of imitation, and imitation (cf. Roger Caillois, who argues that seeing itself is a mode of imitation, an assimilation of the sole to the visual field it projects itself into)—imitation is the most basic experience of experience that there is, and the most aesthetically intense. Acquired taste is as basic and as intense as it gets.\n "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/writing/0/','title':"Essay 0",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 0 - \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; #  Due: Monday, September 7th, 22:00\nPrompt #  We spent the first class reading from five poems.

The essay should be two paragraphs, maybe three. You should describe your engagement with the supplementary materials in the second paragraph.

It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.\nThe sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox.”\n Choose a poem and discuss how its lineation relates to its meaning.\nFurther instructions #  Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that repeat or which stand out to you?

Read his definition below:\n What I feel about these photographs derives from an average affect, almost from a certain training. I did not know a French word which might account for this kind of human interest, but I believe this word exists in Latin: it is studium, which doesn’t mean, at least not immediately, “study,” but application to a thing, taste for someone, a kind of general, enthusiastic commitment, of course, but without special acuity. It is by studium that I am interested in so many photographs, whether I receive them as political testimony or enjoy them as good historical scenes: for it is culturally (this connotation is present in studium) that I participate in the figures, the faces, the gestures, the settings, the actions.\n  The second element will break (or punctuate) the studium. This time it is not I who seek it out (as I invest the field of the studium with my sovereign consciousness), it is this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me. A Latin word exists to designate this wound, this prick, this mark made by a pointed instrument: the word suits me all the better in that it also refers to the notion of punctuation, and because the photographs I am speaking of are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds are so many points. This second element which will disturb the studium I shall therefore call punctum; for punctum is also: sting, speck, cut, little hole—and also a cast of the dice. A photograph’s punctum is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me). (25-27)\n [Refer to sections 10-24 in Camera Lucida for more.]\nTask #  Find a punctum in a poem of your choosing. It could be word, phrase, line, or sentence at a specific location in the poem. Then write about it. What is it about this punctum that “pricks” you? How does it stand out against the poem\u0026rsquo;s studium? The punctum might be your favorite point in the poem, or it might be the most troubling or confusing. Your description may lead you to discuss other parts of the poem, but make sure to circle back to the punctum at the end of your essay.\nFurther instructions #   In order to describe the punctum you will need to discuss how it diverges from or is separate from the poem’s studium, or what might be called its “normative” language. Use your notes on the ritual and fictional elements of the poem as a guide for identifying such norms. Keep in mind that it may take multiple readings and some time away from the poem in order to figure out what your punctum is. Reading the poem out loud is a necessity; it helps you slow down and notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. Transcribing by hand or keyboard is similarly helpful. A punctum will “overwhelm,” leading to an “intense mutation of [your] interest, a fulguration.” The analogy between photography and poetry is imperfect. Don\u0026rsquo;t take everything Barthes says as some kind of universal truth. For instance, you may not worry too much about the \u0026ldquo;unintentionality\u0026rdquo; of the punctum, since poets often exercise more agency over what appears in their poems than photographers do over what appears in their photographs. The punctum of a poem may seem quite obviously willed by the poet, but remain striking and beautiful. 3-4 pages, 1.5 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style Type up poem or relevant excerpt on first page, use template on Canvas for easy line numbering.

It is also likely that you will be led from your punctum to learn or notice some aspect of the poem you didn’t recognize before. In this way identifying the punctum serves as a research method which will aid you in developing your final essay for the semester.\n "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/docs/writing/4/','title':"Essay 4",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 4 #  Design your own prompt and run it by me.

Write a comparative essay on two different poems of your choosing; they may be poems by the same author, from the same collection, or by different authors working in a related form or genre. Translate a poem into English and write about your choices and any research you did in order to make these choices. Track 3: Write on one poem, but from two different perspectives (two puncta, or using two distinct methods). Write a comparative essay discussing the relationship between a poem and a non-poem.
