What does it feel like to read different kinds of texts? This week we will read five poems by A.R. Ammons, Christian Bök, H.D., Reginald Shepherd, and Juliana Spahr. What do you notice in each? 9/4: Selections from 9/2\nMake the introduction post to the Discussion Board.\nWe will continue with poems on the slides from Day 1.\nCome to class with questions about the syllabus or schedule. Discussion Board  Name (what you would like to be called), pronouns, where you\u0026rsquo;re from, something you like or are interested in that\u0026rsquo;s not poetry. Did you have trouble hearing the instructor or classmates? Ask any questions you may have about the course syllabus/schedule. I will respond next class.        Essay 0 - \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; (Due 9/7, 22:00)\nWeek 2: Sept 7, 9, 11 – Objects #  Individual Conference I\n How does it mean? ↕  9/7: Gertrude Stein, \u0026ldquo;Susie Asado\u0026rdquo; (p. 125), \u0026ldquo;Repetition\u0026rdquo; (PEPP, 1168)\nWhat's the role of repetition in Stein's poetry?\nDoes the meaning of each word \"matter\"?\nPoetics vs. hermeneutics\nPoetry + {song, painting, science, politics} 9/9: Gertrude Stein, Tender Buttons, Harryette Mullen, Recyclopedia\nRead as much of S*PeRM**K*T in Recyclopedia as you can. Focus on Roastbeef in Tender Buttons, explore whatever else catches your eye. Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T directly corresponds to Stein's \u0026ldquo;Food\u0026rdquo; section of Tender Buttons. How does it differentiate itself from its source of inspiration? 9/11: Francis Ponge, \u0026ldquo;The Carnation\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;L\u0026rsquo;œillet\u0026rdquo;), excerpts from Unfinished Ode to Mud, Andrew Epstein,\u0026ldquo;The Rhapsody of Things as They Are\u0026rdquo;\nLet's try to identify specific rhetorical patterns, techniques, and tropes in Ponge\u0026rsquo;s writing which we might employ in our own. Discussion Board Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a \"template text\" to roughly define its length.\n Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, or write a \"scrambled\" set of poems that use similar phrases in different order.  Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English. Try to use registers of speech or \"found linguistic materials\" (like stuff from a COVID-related news report?)...  Stein: Write something highly repetitive and rhythmic, using words that sonically bring to mind the object in question without denoting it directly.  Fourth option: don't copy any of the poets consciously, just write about an object. Then add a paragraph of commentary afterwards on how you feel your poetics relates to the past week's poets—are you doing something completely different? Are there any similarities?  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet's style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.      Week 3: Sept 14, 16, 18 – Line and Meter #   Meaning ↔ Primary structures?  ↕  9/14: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from A Little Book on Form\nPrior to class, put in the #line slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further). Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it \u0026ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making\u0026rdquo;?  9/16: Whitman, \u0026ldquo;Song of Myself\u0026rdquo;; Hass: \u0026ldquo;A Note on Stress,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How to Scan a Poem\u0026rdquo;\nPrior to class, keep a list of favorite lines from Whitman, adding to the #whitman channel one excerpt that you are particularly drawn to, with or without commentary by Tuesday at 22:00. You might want to scan it and discuss what you find. Also put one excerpt from the Hass reading in the #meter channel by Tuesday night. 9/18: Whitman cont., A.R. Ammons: Corsons Inlet; Hass: \u0026ldquo;How Free Verse Works\u0026rdquo;\n Prior to class, make a post in the #freeverse channel. Comment on how line groupings and/or meter function in some excerpt of A.R. Ammons's \"Corsons Inlet\" or Robert Hass's \"Meditation at Lagunitas\" relate to your more immediate reaction to the poem's expression. Post by Thursday @ 22:00. Earlier is better!  After class, start looking at the Sonnet reader and begin drafting your discussion board post, which is essentially a draft or proposal for Essay 1, \"Line.\"  Discussion Board Pick a poem to write about for Essay 1 (Links to an external site.). I suggest you choose any of the poems we've read so far, especially one you've written a comment on, or any sonnet* from the Sonnet Reader (117-sonnets.pdf). As with all future assignments, you're free to find something else on your own.\nFirst write about what you notice, with regards to the meaning or expressive effects of the poem. Then scan it and look for stanzas or line groupings** that stand out to you. Comment on any interesting patterns you find and try to connect these observations with your earlier observations on meaning/expression. Finally, ask a question or make a comment on how your post could be further developed. Post by Sunday at 22:00.\n*If you want to write on a sonnet that's not originally in English, you may want to focus on line groupings, or otherwise do a bit of research on how that language is supposed to be scanned. **If you're dealing with a poem that has no obvious 1/2/3/4-line divisions or metrical pattern (i.e. Corsons Inlet) you should still try to identify the \"ghosts\" of these structures. Remember that trying to impose a rule or structure on a poem and then failing will help you see precisely where and how it exceeds those boundaries/expectations. Merely stating that a poem does not fit into categories is not enough to make this truth sufficiently vivid. You can be candid about the fact that an experiment or methodology is not the best fit for a poem in your writing, and choose not to use it at all in future essays, but for the purposes of this upcoming essay I'd like you to try your best to use \"meter\" and \"line\" as analytical categories.      Essay 1 \u0026ldquo;Line\u0026rdquo; (Due 9/25, 22:00)\nRevisions, if needed, are due on October 7.\nWeek 4: Sept 21, 23, 25 – Sonnet #  We will take an \u0026ldquo;inductive\u0026rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile? A small \"reader\" has been uploaded on Canvas (  Files  Sonnet  129-sonnets.pdf ).  Why the sonnet? ↕  9/21: Essay 1 Discussion, Sonnet reader\nBefore class, take a look at the sonnets in the reader. Choose a sonnet to share in the #sonnet channel. You may give general impressions and write about its meter, rhyme, or line groupings. In class we'll talk about the discussion board posts and upcoming essay, and then talk about some of your chosen sonnets. 9/23: Sonnet reader (cont.)\nPlease post to #sonnet prior to class. If you have already posted a sonnet, post another one. We'll continue talking about sonnets today, identifying common topics, trends in historical development, and variations in form (rhyme, cross-linguistic meter, length, stanza structure). We'll also do some reading exercises with the short essays from Art of the Sonnet to practice extracting key ideas quickly from secondary texts. 9/25: Sonnet reader (cont.) Art of the Sonnet, Introduction (p. 5-25)\nPrior to class, focus on finishing Essay 1. If you have time, read the introduction of Art of the Sonnet and peruse some of the short essays on individual sonnets. When you're done, read the given page range of Post-Petrarchism for Monday. In class, we will try to consolidate some of the observations we made in class on Wednesday with a lecture on the Early Modern sonnet and the function of the poetic conceit.    Week 5: Sept 28, 30, Oct 2 – Sonnet #  9/28: Sonnet reader (cont.) Post-Petrarchism, Introduction (p. 1-13)\nPrior to class, read and take your own notes on ritual and fiction dimensions of a sonnet from the reader. We will discuss sonnets from the 19th century onward see how we can apply these concepts to various poems. We will also develop an understanding of how our previous discussions of line, meter, and conceit, relate to the two new terms.\nOptional reading: \"On the Margins of Discourse\" by Barbara Herrnstein Smith. This is referenced in the definition of \"fiction\" in Greene's book and is a very clear, interesting read. 9/30: Sonnet reader (cont.), Post-Petrarchism, Chapter 1 (p. 22-27)\nChoose a sonnet and think about how it uses deixis in an interesting manner. Bring your thoughts to class. We will see how we can apply deixis to various sonnets, and our focus will move beyond the individual poem to poems in sequences or groups. 10/2: Sonnet reader (cont.), Theory of the Lyric, Chapter 1 (p. 10-38)\nPay close attention to how the nine poems presented in the chapter are analyzed. Prior to class, choose a sonnet (or other poem); write a sentence or two in #post-petrarchism on how it involves deixis, ritual and fiction, and/or the four parameters (enunciative-apparatus, being-event, re-performance, hyperbolic-risk). Please do this by 21:00. Week 6: Oct 5, Oct 7, Oct 9 – Ode #  This week we pay closer attention to the notion of \"voice\" or \"address\" in longer ode-like poems. Oct 5 - John Ashbery, \u0026ldquo;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror\u0026rdquo;\n Read p. 68-76 of the Ashbery poem.  Then write a comment in #ashbery on a segment of the poem which felt particularly vivid, present, or clear to you and one which felt vague, abstract, or confusing. Does identifying deictics or finding instances of the four parameters at work change your understanding of that segment? Do this by 21:00 on Sunday.  Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you're having trouble with Ashbery.  You may also want to refer to the Parmigianino painting referred to in the poem's title. Oct 7 - T.S. Eliot, \u0026ldquo;The Three Voices of Poetry\u0026rdquo;; Ashbery cont.\n Read the Eliot essay.  Read the rest of \"Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror\" (76-83).  See if you can identify instances of the first, second, and/or third voices in the poem.  Add to #ashbery a quote from the Eliot essay alongside a segment from the poem; comment on how the two relate or diverge. Do this by 21:00.  In class, we'll talk about our affective responses to different parts of the poem and how personal deictics and the notion of the three voices might help us understand these responses.  Oct 9 - Marianne Moore, \u0026ldquo;An Octopus\u0026rdquo;\nWe'll consider how this poem works alongside the various concepts we've encountered over the past two weeks: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, the three voices—and ask ourselves which of these theories seemed most helpful. Discussion Board Start Essay 2; post two paragraphs. These can be from the body of the essay or the introduction. I recommend including a quotation from the theorist you want to cite. Please do this by 21:00 on Sunday so I have time to look over them before class.   Essay 2 “Ritual vs Fiction” (Due 10/16, 22:00)\nRevisions, if needed, are due on October 26.\nWeek 7: Oct 12, 16 – Image #  Individual Conference II\nWhat's the difference between imagism and symbolism? How about metaphor and metonymy? How do images arise from or relate to the ritual and fictional dimensions of the lyric? Oct 12 - Barthes, Camera Lucida (First part); Selected poems by Paul Celan, Aimé Césaire, Emily Dickinson, Mina Loy, Stéphane Mallarmé, Tomas Tranströmer\nWe will read some of Barthes together in class, and discuss the validity of identifying poetry with photography. We will also practice identifying puncta in both photos and poems. Try to read half of Barthes (p. 18-30) by today or Tuesday and the rest (p. 31-60) by Friday. No classes on October 14.  Oct 16 - Selected poems by Paul Celan, Aimé Césaire, Emily Dickinson, Mina Loy, Stéphane Mallarmé, Tomas Tranströmer, César Vallejo\nFinish reading the first half of Barthes. Review the poems before class.\nWe'll discuss images that are striking or interesting and why this is the case. Week 8: Oct 19, 21, 23 – Image (cont.) #  Oct 19 - José Lezama Lima, \u0026ldquo;Muerte de Narciso\u0026rdquo;\nWe will discuss \"Muerte de Narciso\" and the nature of \"symbols\" Oct 21 - Lezama Lima, \u0026ldquo;Confluences\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;Symbolism\u0026rdquo; (PEPP)\nWe will continue to discuss the poem, but with greater focus on the essay. Oct 23 - Review session\nEssay 3 “Punctum” (Due 10/30, 22:00)\nDiscussion Board Comment on a particular word or phrase that might be a \"punctum\" for you—choose any of this week's readings, or one of the previously discussed poems. Try to free associate (you can include personal associations) and don't worry too much about adhering to essayistic conventions. By now, you may have a pretty good idea of what poem(s) you will write about for the final paper, so it's best to write about something you see yourself writing on more.   Week 9: Oct 26, 28, 30 – Georgic #  This week involves poems of instruction or information. What makes a modern \"Georgic\"? How do we analyze an entire book? Oct 26 - Virgil, Georgics (Book IV); Hass, \u0026ldquo;Georgic\u0026rdquo;\nPreparation: TBA Oct 28 - Christopher Dewdney, The Natural History (1)\nPreparation: TBA Oct 30 - Dionne Brand, The Blue Clerk\nPreparation: TBA Week 10: Nov 2, 4, 6 — Who are Poets? #  This week is an opportunity to practice description–of the poet's voice, attitude, style, etc. More specifically, we are going to think about adjectives. Nov 2 - Emerson, \u0026ldquo;The Poet,\u0026rdquo; Allen Grossman, Summa Lyrica\nNov 4 - Ezra Pound, selections from ABCs of Reading, Personae\nNov 6 - Rilke, \u0026ldquo;Letters to a Young Poet\u0026rdquo;\nDiscussion Board What do you plan on writing about for your final essay, and how do you plan on going about it? Make a list of sources you want to use and how you plan on using them.   Week 11: Nov 9, 11, 13 — Poetic Value #  We will talk about poetry's \"value\" and how poems are valued: what kinds of expectation, forms of attention, modes of engagement allow for the appreciation of poetry. Nov 9 - Will Alexander, essays\nNov 11 - Reginald Shepherd, \u0026ldquo;To Make Me Who I Am\u0026rdquo;\nNov 13 - Ben Lerner, The Hatred of Poetry (cont.)\nEssay 4 \u0026ldquo;Final\u0026rdquo; (Draft) (Due 11/16, 22:00)\n Week 12, 13: Semi-Finals, Thanksgiving #  Individual Conference III\n(Schedule between 11/16 and 11/29)\nNo class from 11/16\u0026ndash;11/29. Classes resume online on 11/30.  Special: Attend a colloquium on Lucy Alford\u0026rsquo;s Forms of Poetic Attention at the Stanford Poetics Workshop at 4 PM (EST) on Friday, 11/20. Email me for Zoom invite link.  Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations #  Guidelines Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:\n Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion. Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better. During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.  Here are some suggestions for what to present:\n Poem-centric: Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing. Essay-centric: Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications. Idea-centric: Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you\u0026rsquo;d like to include. Class-centric: Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you\u0026rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the last presenters.  These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.\n  Nov 30: One, Two, Three\nDec 2: Four, Five\nDec 4: Six, Seven\nWeek 15: Dec 7, 9, 11 — Presentations #  Dec 7: Eight, Nine\nDec 9: Ten, Eleven\nDec 11: Twelve, Thirteen\nWeek 16: Dec 14, 16 — Presentations #  Dec 14: Fourteen, Fifteen\nDec 16: Sixteen, Seventeen\nEssay 4 “Final” (Due 12/17, 22:00)\nCourse-Teacher Evaluations due (online)\nFinal exam period runs from December 17-20.   var tooltipSpan = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tooltip-reveal\"); window.onmousemove = function(e) { var x = e.clientX, y = e.clientY; for (var i = 0; i "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/writing/','title':"Writing",'section':"Docs",'content':"Essay Horizon #  The essay sequence is designed to lead you to a final paper. Each of the assignments emphasizes a different skill, mode of argumentation, or type of writing. Here's a brief synopsis of what you should be learning by completing each essay: Essay 0: Centers observation, under few constraints. Reveals what you are accustomed to seeing in poems. The most successful essays are detailed but concise, and follow the two-step structure of the essay with fidelity. This is a bit like a journal entry, or a field report.\nEssay 1: Centers observation under a specific formal vocabulary (line, meter). Tests your ability to produce a succinct description of the essay\u0026rsquo;s overarching method and trajectory, and to fluidly link a heterogenous set of observations under that program. The \u0026ldquo;program\u0026rdquo; in all likelihood takes the form of the basic question: how do line groupings and meter contribute to the meaning of the poem? Some amount of external research may be incorporated to form a sense of the latter. The essay may leave you filled with ideas, overwhelmed, unsure of how to interpret it all. It may result in writing that is either too chaotic or too clinical. But at very least you will feel you have thought a lot and learned from it. This is a mixture between a journal entry and a science experiment.\nEssay 2: Centers persuasion and dialogue; you are responsible for choosing your theoretical vocabulary and showing how it adds to your experience of reading a poem or poems. By doing so, you are making an argument for the value of that term and the value of the poetry you write about. For instance, you may discover that you enjoy poems that are particularly hyperbolic, poems which involve many fictive utterances, or poems which are more ritualistic in nature. Or you may deliberately challenge your tastes by finding a poem you don\u0026rsquo;t immediately like and attempt to understand why using the theoretical terms we have encountered lately. By the end of this assignment, you should feel quite confident in constructing essays with a clear \u0026ldquo;argument\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;purpose,\u0026rdquo; and which likewise employ effective rhetorical \u0026ldquo;turns\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;moves.\u0026rdquo; This is closest to a standard academic essay.\nEssay 3: This one takes on the simpler, bipartite format of Essay 0, and also centers the subjective question, \u0026ldquo;What do you notice?\u0026rdquo; However, it gives you a chance to use whatever new tools you have encountered in this course to describe the \u0026ldquo;studium\u0026rdquo;, and to write in a more personal style when describing the \u0026ldquo;punctum.\u0026rdquo; Some amount of historical and biographical research may be included in order to write about the \u0026ldquo;studium,\u0026rdquo; you may wish to imagine the poet\u0026rsquo;s world, the conditions under which the poem was written. This essay may resemble journalistic writing or creative non-fiction to a greater degree than the previous ones. The main goal of this assignment is to hone your sentence-level writing, to develop a descriptive voice.\nEssay 4: You may choose to expand what you wrote for Essay 0, Essay 1, Essay 2, and Essay 3 or to refactor the prompts in order to design the fourth. The essay should have an intriguing and well-designed argumentative structure, and be fairly well-written on the sentence level. Since you will be given more time and space to write this essay, you will also incorporate some amount of research, which could help you tie this project closer to interests that were not explicitly a part of this class.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/resources/','title':"Resources",'section':"Docs",'content':"Resources #   Oxford English Dictionary https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation https://www.library.cornell.edu/services/apps/passkey  Poetry  Poetry Foundation ubuweb Pennsound arquivopessoa.net Norton Anthology of Poetry The Making of a Sonnet, ed.

Learning is often difficult and cause for discomfort. Sometimes we will read things that are totally mystifying, which were written in older versions of the English language and that are therefore a bit difficult to get into. Many poems take time and repeated readings to become attuned to, but you may find that some are simply not for you. One of the best experiences you can have is to learn to appreciate something you didn\u0026rsquo;t like before, or to see a new aspect of something you do already enjoy.1 However, we write and think best when we\u0026rsquo;re glad to spend time with our thoughts and whatever it is that we are studying. If you\u0026rsquo;re having concerns about not liking the readings for this course, here are a few things you might do:\n Write about your alienation or distaste for a text. Reach out to me and let me know about your concerns. Ask a peer about their own reactions to readings, see if you can get a person who is a fan of a text to explain why they like it. Find poems you do like and try to understand why. Read the text multiple times. Try to understand why it was written. Try to understand a text in terms of its impact on other writers.   Ideally you should ideally use a combination of these tactics to help you find value in texts that are difficult to appreciate. Never feel bad about your reactions to texts, but be careful not to dismiss something too loudly or quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting to hear about others\u0026rsquo; responses before coming to a more final judgment.\nWhat am I enjoying most? #  This is a critical question, as it should be the main heuristic for choosing what to write about. The question of taste might be broken down into three components:\n(1) What poems am I enjoying?\nI encourage you to write your final paper on a poem or set of poems that you really like and want to spend time reading and thinking about. Keep in mind that the more you read with care and openness to others' perspectives, the more likely it is that you will develop a heightened appreciation of whatever poems you end up preferring, which will in turn make the final essay experience more meaningful. (2) What exercises, discussions, and ideas am I drawn to?\nKeeping this question in mind will help you develop a method, a research question, and a more specific analytical toolkit for approaching the poem(s) you love. Often people express a fear that analyzing a work of art will \"deaden\" it. You should be on the lookout for methodologies that heighten your appreciation of and interest in your topic. (3) What aspects of writing do I feel best about?\nWriting can be a fearsome and paralyzing process. Knowing what you value in writing will help you begin and sustain any complex effort. When you read over your drafts, ask yourself what is going well before jumping to self-criticism. I tend to provide feedback that highlights and amplifies strong points in your writing. Make changes in service of your strengths, not merely to \"correct\" a perceived weakness. (3) What\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this class? #  Our focus on \u0026ldquo;lyric poetry\u0026rdquo; means that you will be encouraged to read poems closely and repeatedly. Repeated reading is closely aligned with the goal of becoming comfortable with re-reading and revising your own work, which is necessary to becoming a strong writer and an empathetic, astute listener.\nPoetry is a particularly keen source of knowledge and pleasure for writers. The artifice and extremity of poetic language helps produce insights about how language works and what its capacities are more generally.\nPoems can and do cover pretty much every topic under the sun. Everyone should be able to find some poem or poet who effectively engages with extra-poetic interests. As a freshman, one of your main goals this year is to figure out what to major in, and I hope this course will guide you in that process by giving you the latitude to seek out poems that bring you closer to your personal ambitions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to read poetry alone, and to find time for reading anything in this careful and iterative sense. Taking a writing course on reading poetry will provide a special framework for engaging with something that is important and powerful but difficult to access.\n(4) What\u0026rsquo;s my role in this class? #  We\u0026rsquo;re here to learn from each other, and participate in a poetry-reading and writing community. Going to class and entering group discussions should not feel totally separate from whatever thoughts you may be having inside your own head. Writing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a private process.\nThe specifics of your role in this community are for you to determine. You might ask yourself some sub-questions, such as, \u0026ldquo;What makes the study of poetry compelling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How is poetry \u0026ldquo;useful\u0026rdquo; in other domains of knowledge and innovation?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s my relationship to poetry?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What kinds of writing do you want to produce in the future?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the instructor may be the primary leader of the course, he is not the sole arbiter of ideas. Everyone has views that are unique and interesting; everyone is capable of leading discussions and influencing the direction of the course.\n Notes #  [1] \u0026quot;Acquired tastes and the pleasures of imitation\u0026quot; by William Flesch ↩\n There\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure in the experience of conversion. Wittgenstein writes (of psychoanalysis) that when we are disinclined to accept something, we are also inclined to accept it. Why? Not because disinclination is repression of desire, but because desire comes from the overcoming of disinclination. The pleasure is one of discovery and novelty, if not in the object (how boring Clarissa is!) then in the self (how riveting it is!). We don\u0026rsquo;t see differently, but we alter our relation to seeing. That\u0026rsquo;s a second order experience worth having.\n  Second-order? Even on the receptive side, art is the experience of imitation, and imitation (cf. Roger Caillois, who argues that seeing itself is a mode of imitation, an assimilation of the sole to the visual field it projects itself into)—imitation is the most basic experience of experience that there is, and the most aesthetically intense. Acquired taste is as basic and as intense as it gets.\n "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/writing/0/','title':"Essay 0",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 0 - \u0026ldquo;First Day\u0026rdquo; #  Due: Monday, September 7th, 22:00\nPrompt #  We spent the first class reading from five poems. Pick one, re-read it and write about what you notice first (15 minutes). Then familiarize yourself with its source or supplementary materials (as noted on the slides). Take a break and do something entirely unrelated. Re-read the poem, and write about anything new you observe (30 minutes).\nExample, from Chapter I of Eunoia:\n Writing is inhibiting. Sighing, I sit, scribbling in ink\nthis pidgin script. I sing with nihilistic witticism,\ndisciplining signs with trifling gimmicks – impish\nhijinks which highlight stick sigils. Isn’t it glib?\nIsn’t it chic? I fit childish insights within rigid limits,\nwriting shtick which might instill priggish misgiv-\nings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nit-\npicking criticism which flirts with philistinism. I\nbitch; I kibitz – griping whilst criticizing dimwits, sniping whilst indicting nitwits, dismissing simplis-\ntic thinking, in which philippic wit is still illicit.\n  On first reading, I observed that every word uses only the vowel \u0026lsquo;i\u0026rsquo;....\n On second reading, I realized that the first-person perspective of the passage is correlated with the univocalic constraint....  On first reading, I felt a sense of irritation....\n On second reading, I felt a humor in the text.... (See Canvas Files \u0026gt; Slides \u0026gt; September 2nd.pdf)\nFurther instructions #   Feel free to complete one of the above trains of thought. You may use a pattern-focused approach (what linguistic patterns do I notice?), affective approach (what mood or sensation do I feel?), rhetorical approach (what do I believe the purpose of this text to be?), or hermeneutic approach (what do I think this text means?) to refine the scope of your thinking. The essay should be two paragraphs, maybe three. You should describe your engagement with the supplementary materials in the second paragraph. If there is a link between the first and second paragraphs, feel free to reflect on that in the third. Use the listed time constraints for drafting the essay, but spend some time beyond the initial 45 minutes editing what you have written. You may find the Oxford English Dictionary helpful, especially if you notice a word that is new to you or want to refer to its etymology for the second reading. 1-2 pages, 1.5 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style Grade: (Timely) Completion. This is a low-stakes assignment. Submit: On Canvas as PDF.  Looking Ahead #  Deploying this kind of exercise regularly will help you become more attentive to your own reading practices, sensibilities, and habits. Time-constrained observational writing is an excellent tool for beginning the more complex assignments we will encounter later in this course.\n "});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/writing/1/','title':"Essay 1",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 1 - \u0026ldquo;Line\u0026rdquo; #  Due Wednesday, 9/25, 22:00\nRevisions due on 10/7, 22:00\nPrompt #  Consider the following passage from Robert Hass\u0026rsquo;s A Little Book on Form:\n The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.\nThe sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox. (11)\n Choose a poem and think about how its lineation relates to its meaning. Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? How is enjambment used in the poem? How long are the lines, and what are their syntactic components? Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that stand out to you? Do these groupings form archetypal patterns like call-and-response or syllogism? Write about how a feature of the poem\u0026rsquo;s lineation relates to its meaning.\n— or — Choose a poem and read it out loud. Determine which excerpts of the poem appeal to you most, and scan them. See if you notice any patterns in the meter which relate to the meaning or other aspects of your favorite lines (which may include syntax, for instance). Here\u0026rsquo;s a corresponding inspirational quote from Hass—\n The work of prosody in free verse, as in metrical verse, comes once the poem is under way. The twos and threes, or the fours and threes and then fours; the choice of making stanzas or not making stanzas, what kind of line endings—that work. You are hearing a poem that is grave and slow, or charged and relentless, or hesitant, or easy and fluid, the sense of sound, arc of development, play with undevelopment, image- or thought-cascade occurring and telling you what it wants to be, form and content beginning to be a body. The final form exactly right, or not—seeming just okay, adequate to the task, but not radiant, not the radiance. (428)\n —— Here\u0026rsquo;s a suggested list of poems to write about:\n Walt Whitman's \"Song of Myself\" (either the 1855 or 1891-92 version)  Robert Hass's \"Meditation at Lagunitas\"  A Robert Frost poem mentioned in A Little Book on Form  Any poem by A.R. Ammons, especially \"Corsons Inlet\"  Any poem in H.D.'s Sea Garden  Any poem in Reginald Shepherd's Otherhood  Any of the sonnets in the sonnet reader  Gertrude Stein's \"Susie Asado\"  Further instructions #   Your essay should demonstrate clear intent to respond to the prompt.  Cite a passage from Hass's book to frame your argument.  Help the reader understand why line-groupings of 1, 2, or 3 are important to reading the poem. If you're doing the meter prompt, help your reader understand the importance of meter in reading the poem, by identifying specific rhythmic effects (ex. rising or falling feet) or metrical patterns.  The introduction should include a question or conjecture.  The final paragraph should reconstruct your argument (i.e., summarize it concisely) and reflect on possible routes for further inquiry.  When making a general claim, remind the reader of precisely what you are referring to by quoting directly from the text. If you're writing about meter, denote meter-markings below a quoted line from a poem using u (unstressed) and ' (stressed) to denote the syllables. Separate feet, if applicable, using / or // for a caesura.  Do not make general claims that invite lengthy extra-poetic discussion (or else frame them as a subjective response or impression: \"I tend to think of x as y...\")  Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, free of grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.  Sentences should flow well. They should be varied in length and syntax in a way that helps the reader stay engaged throughout the reading process.  Sentences should be sequenced in a way that makes sense. If the essay is entering digressive or speculative territory, or suddenly jumping to a new topic, there should be a clear justification for this choice.  Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially prepositions and verbs.  Use the proper tense (mostly present) and person (mostly first and third). Avoid the pronoun \"it\" unless the antecedent is clear.  Include proper in-text citations (including citations of line numbers).  Transcribe the poem and include as Appendix of your paper. Tip: use poem-template on Canvas, and append to your essay after everything has been converted to PDF. This way you can keep the poem document and the essay separate and view them side-by-side. If you chose to write on Corsons Inlet, then you can just recycle the template. If you are doing a lot of metrical analysis on a shorter poem, you can use the meter template to do a full scansion.  The body of the paper should be around 4 pages, with a title, MLA formatting, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. This should include Hass's book and the poem, plus any encyclopedia or dictionary entries you may have consulted.

The deadline for revision may be modified depending on how fast the instructor is able to return feedback. If you have even the smallest question don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask.\nLooking Ahead #  This exercise will help you identify an important formal element of poetry, and will also require you to provide a description of a poem\u0026rsquo;s meaning. The process of connecting structural patterns to your impressions of a poem\u0026rsquo;s overall insights will prepare you for future essays in this course.\n "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/writing/2/','title':"Essay 2",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 2 - \u0026ldquo;Ritual and Fiction\u0026rdquo; #  Due Wednesday, 10/16 at 22:00,\nRevisions due on 10/26 at 22:00\nPrompt #  As we have discussed in class, lyric poems may be defined in terms of their “ritual” and “fictional” elements, in terms of the \u0026ldquo;four parameters,\u0026rdquo; or in terms of the \u0026ldquo;three voices.\u0026rdquo; Choose a poem (or several short ones) and demonstrate how it embodies any of these categories. You may choose to use only one of these theoretical approaches, or a blend of several. Here are some sub-prompts you may choose to address:\n Choose a poem and identify specific words and lines where the ritual element is particularly salient. Then consider how the poem inhabits a fictional space—How it might be narrated as in a novel or film? Who is speaking? What is being described? What are the relationships between the speaker(s) and object(s) in the “scene” of the poem? Then show how the two dimensions interact or feed off of one another. Choose a set of two or more sonnets and describe how the ritual and fictional dimensions unfold through this group or sequence. Write about how a poem embodies the first, second, and third voice described by Eliot. Show how a poem embodies the hyperbolic mode identified by Culler in his four parameters. Then show how this hyperbolic mode is intertwined with any of the other four parameters: enunciative-apparatus, re-performance, or being-event. Show how a poem\u0026rsquo;s conceit pertains to ritual, fiction, or the various modes of address in Culler/Eliot\u0026rsquo;s texts.  Specifications #   The first paragraph should capture the reader's attention and induce some level of curiosity by effectively pointing out why the poem you are writing about is interesting and why the theoretical term you are using is relevant to that poem.  Respond persuasively to the prompt. How do you understand the theoretical term you are citing? In what ways is it helpful for reading, interpreting, or gaining a better appreciation for the poem(s) you are writing about? Are you using the term exactly as the original author intended it to be used, or are you modifying it slightly and/or taking it into a new context? Convince the reader that using these terms, or your modifications of them, is a worthwhile endeavor.  Include a question in your introduction (first or second paragraph), as a brief synopsis of the rest of your essay.  The last paragraph should reconstruct your argument and reflect on what is unresolved, and/or propose routes for further inquiry. It's a good idea to include a question here too.  Provide vivid evidence of your claims by quoting directly and concisely from the text. Avoid commonplace statements (clichés). Include block quotes only where especially apt or where you plan on engaging in prolonged commentary on specific words throughout the quote.  Sentences should be sequenced in a way that is clearly motivated and which propels the reader's interest forward. Pay special attention to the last and first sentences of each paragraph, which should act as the connective thread of the essay.  Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, employing more complex and vibrant language where appropriate. Interweave short and long, simple and complex; use contrasts to your advantage. Avoid unwarranted repetition of words and phrases.  Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially adjectives, prepositions and verbs. Use the simplest word possible in most cases. Define terms that may have a specialized or otherwise non-obvious meaning.  Use the proper tense (mostly the simple present).  Use subjective language when you are making a claim that you don’t expect most readers could see for themselves. Otherwise, use objective language (e.g. “The poem does x”) or the first-person plural (e.g. “We observe that”).  Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. This normally takes the form of Noun-Phrase + Prepositional-Phrase, e.g. \"Ritual and Fiction in Rilke's New Poems.\"  Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the \"Appendix\" of your paper and cite line numbers from the Appendix. Tip: Use template on Canvas.  Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. If typing up meter, do it in a consistent style, following the guidelines from Essay 1.  The paper should be relatively free of typographical and spelling errors, which includes extra spaces. Take care to put periods and commas inside quotation marks.  The body of the paper should be around 4 pages.

Read his definition below:\n What I feel about these photographs derives from an average affect, almost from a certain training. I did not know a French word which might account for this kind of human interest, but I believe this word exists in Latin: it is studium, which doesn’t mean, at least not immediately, “study,” but application to a thing, taste for someone, a kind of general, enthusiastic commitment, of course, but without special acuity. It is by studium that I am interested in so many photographs, whether I receive them as political testimony or enjoy them as good historical scenes: for it is culturally (this connotation is present in studium) that I participate in the figures, the faces, the gestures, the settings, the actions.\n  The second element will break (or punctuate) the studium. This time it is not I who seek it out (as I invest the field of the studium with my sovereign consciousness), it is this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me. A Latin word exists to designate this wound, this prick, this mark made by a pointed instrument: the word suits me all the better in that it also refers to the notion of punctuation, and because the photographs I am speaking of are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds are so many points. This second element which will disturb the studium I shall therefore call punctum; for punctum is also: sting, speck, cut, little hole—and also a cast of the dice. A photograph’s punctum is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me). (25-27)\n [Refer to sections 10-24 in Camera Lucida for more.]\nFind a punctum in a poem of your choosing. It could be word, phrase, line, or sentence at a specific location in the poem. Then write about it. What is it about this punctum that “pricks” you? How does it stand out against the poem\u0026rsquo;s studium? The punctum might be your favorite point in the poem, or it might be the most troubling or confusing. Your description may lead you to discuss other parts of the poem, but make sure to circle back to the punctum at the end of your essay.\nFurther notes #   A punctum will “overwhelm,” leading to an “intense mutation of [your] interest, a fulguration.” In order to describe the punctum you will need to discuss how it diverges from or is separate from the poem’s studium, or what might be called its “normative” language. Use your notes on the ritual and fictional elements of the poem as a guide for identifying such norms. Or, treat the poem like a photograph that comes from a place and time—do historical or biographical research on the poet, or on the images and allusions involved in the poem (scientific conceits, for instance). Keep in mind that it may take multiple readings and some time away from the poem in order to figure out what your punctum is. Reading the poem out loud is a necessity; it helps you slow down and notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. Transcribing by hand or keyboard is similarly helpful. The analogy between photography and poetry is imperfect. Don\u0026rsquo;t take everything Barthes says as some kind of universal truth. For instance, you may not worry too much about the \u0026ldquo;unintentionality\u0026rdquo; of the punctum, since poets often exercise more agency over what appears in their poems than photographers do over what appears in their photographs. The punctum of a poem may seem quite obviously willed by the poet, but remain striking and beautiful.  Specifications #   Include a rich description of the poem's studium and its punctum.  Provide a brief summary of Barthes' terms so that the reader knows how you construe these ideas; provide relevant citations. Again, you may modify the definitions provided by Barthes to better suit your own purposes, just be explicit about this.  Exercise care in your choice of words, syntax, and sentence sequencing.  Make sure the paper is relatively free of typographical and spelling errors.  Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the \"Appendix\" of your paper, prior to the Works Cited page.  Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing. The body of the paper should be around 4 pages. Submit to Canvas as a PDF.  Grading criteria #  You will be doing peer review on this paper, and I will provide an evaluative comment. Otherwise, this paper is for a completion grade, meaning that you must satisfy items 1-2 and 5-6. While there is no \u0026ldquo;revision window\u0026rdquo; for this essay, you may want to use this as a prototype for Essay 4, and should incorporate feedback prior to turning in the Essay 4 draft.\nLooking Ahead #  Identifying a punctum can be a strong way of starting an essay and developing a focal question. Writing about the studium is a way of incorporating external research into this paper. The personal nature of the studium may also allow you to incorporate modes of writing that are more narrative or journalistic in nature. This essay will hopefully allow you to reflect on which theoretical methods you prefer to use, what poems you enjoy writing about, what challenges you are facing when doing external research, and how you relate to your subject matter.\n "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/docs/writing/4/','title':"Essay 4",'section':"Writing",'content':"Essay 4 - \u0026ldquo;Prompt\u0026rdquo; #  Draft due 11/16 or 11/30 at 22:00\nFinal due 12/17 at 22:00\nPrompt #  Design your own prompt or recycle one of the previous three.

Is the argument interesting? By \"interesting\" I mean falsifiable and somewhat unexpected—the reader will not want to read about something that seems obviously true.  Language\nClarity, simplicity, and concision are preferred, but vibrant, complex, eclectic language is often necessary when dealing with poetic materials. You may have to do some work to find the right words to describe something. Use contrasts to your advantage. Longer sentences are punctuated by shorter ones. Objective language is interwoven with subjective language, etc.  Typography\nLack of typos, adherence to MLA formatting rules. Very important as many of your future professors, employers, and peers will glance at your work and not take it seriously if they immediately find \"careless\" mistakes. Guard yourself against bias!  Looking Ahead #  Being able to design your own prompt or expand on previous work is an essential skill for future research, where you will be responsible for framing the parameters of your own project. I hope this class also gives you some tools for reading poems and other kinds of texts—visual, musical, etc.—and learning from them.\n "});})();
