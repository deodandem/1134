We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>
<p>9/21: <em>Art of the Sonnet,</em> selected sonnets</p>
<p class="descript">
    Read the Introduction (p. 5-25) from <i>Art of the Sonnet.</i> Start reading poems from the Sonnet Reader; post poems that catch your eye in <span class="slack">#sonnet</span>. We'll pick out some quotes from the AoS Intro and look at some poems in the Sonnet reader in class. A few questions we will address: Why 14 lines? Why these rhyme schemes? Why and how did this form emerge? What are common topics addressed by the sonnet? What are its rhetorical stances and social, political, and/or aesthetic functions?
<p>9/23: Early Modern Sonnets</p>
<p class="descript">
    Continue posting sonnets in <span class="slack">#sonnet</span>, particularly those from the 19th-21st centuries. We will discuss the Early Modern sonnets (e.g., Petrarch, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Sor Juana) and look at some associated paintings. Why are death and eros such common topics, and how do these poets approach them?

<li>Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.</li>
<li>Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.</li>
<li>During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions for what to present:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poem-centric:</strong> Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you&rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.</li>
<li><strong>Essay-centric:</strong> Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Idea-centric:</strong> Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you&rsquo;d like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Class-centric:</strong> Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you&rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you&rsquo;re one of the last presenters.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.</p>
