  <strong>Discussion Board</strong> — Think about our discussions of rhyme and repetition this week and identify an idea you would like to respond to. Then, find an excerpt from the PEPP entries or a poem which addresses that idea. Finally, write a poem responding to that quotation.

Regardless, write a brief paragraph afterwards sharing the quote and reflecting on your process, and how satisfied you are with your response to the cited text. <u>Post by 2/20 at 22:00. <b>Upload your work as a PDF attachment to a DB post; follow MLA formatting and citation rules.</b></u>

We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).

  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p>Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.</li>
<li>Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.</li>
<li>During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions for what to present:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poem-centric:</strong> Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you&rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.</li>
<li><strong>Essay-centric:</strong> Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Idea-centric:</strong> Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you&rsquo;d like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Class-centric:</strong> Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you&rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you&rsquo;re one of the last presenters.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.</p>
