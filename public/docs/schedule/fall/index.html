  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p class = "descript">
Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a "template text" to roughly define its length.</p>
<ul class="descript">
  <li> Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, or write a "scrambled" set of poems that use similar phrases in different order.
  <li> Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English. Try to use registers of speech or "found linguistic materials" (like stuff from a COVID-related news report?)...
  <li> Stein: Write something highly repetitive and rhythmic, using words that sonically bring to mind the object in question without denoting it directly.
  <li> Fourth option: don't copy any of the poets consciously, just write about an object. Then add a paragraph of commentary afterwards on how you feel your poetics relates to the past week's poets—are you doing something completely different? Are there any similarities?
</ul>
<p class = "descript">
  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet's style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.

  <summary>Discussion Board</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p class="descript">
Pick a poem to write about for Essay 1 (Links to an external site.). I suggest you choose any of the poems we've read so far, especially one you've written a comment on, or any sonnet* from the Sonnet Reader (117-sonnets.pdf). As with all future assignments, you're free to find something else on your own.</p>
<p class="descript">
First write about what you notice, with regards to the meaning or expressive effects of the poem. Then scan it and look for stanzas or line groupings** that stand out to you. Comment on any interesting patterns you find and try to connect these observations with your earlier observations on meaning/expression. Finally, ask a question or make a comment on how your post could be further developed. Post by Sunday at 22:00.</p>
<p class="descript">
*If you want to write on a sonnet that's not originally in English, you may want to focus on line groupings, or otherwise do a bit of research on how that language is supposed to be scanned.
</p>
<p class="descript">
**If you're dealing with a poem that has no obvious 1/2/3/4-line divisions or metrical pattern (i.e. Corsons Inlet) you should still try to identify the "ghosts" of these structures. Remember that trying to impose a rule or structure on a poem and then failing will help you see precisely where and how it exceeds those boundaries/expectations. Merely stating that a poem does not fit into categories is not enough to make this truth sufficiently vivid. You can be candid about the fact that an experiment or methodology is not the best fit for a poem in your writing, and choose not to use it at all in future essays, but for the purposes of this upcoming essay I'd like you to try your best to use "meter" and "line" as analytical categories.

We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>
<p>9/21: Essay 1 Discussion, Sonnet reader</p>
<p class="descript">
Before class, take a look at the sonnets in the reader. Choose a sonnet to share in the <span class="slack">#sonnet</span> channel. You may give general impressions and write about its meter, rhyme, or line groupings. In class we'll talk about the discussion board posts and upcoming essay, and then talk about some of your chosen sonnets.
</p>
<p>9/23: Sonnet reader (cont.)</p>
<p class="descript">
Please post to <span class="slack">#sonnet</span> prior to class. If you have already posted a sonnet, post another one. We'll continue talking about sonnets today, identifying common topics, trends in historical development, and variations in form (rhyme, cross-linguistic meter, length, stanza structure). We'll also do some reading exercises with the short essays from <i>Art of the Sonnet</i> to practice extracting key ideas quickly from secondary texts.
</p>
<p>9/25: Sonnet reader (cont.) <em>Art of the Sonnet,</em> Introduction (p. 5-25)</p>
<p class="descript">
Prior to class, focus on finishing Essay 1. If you have time, read the introduction of <i>Art of the Sonnet</i> and peruse some of the short essays on individual sonnets. When you're done, read the given page range of <i>Post-Petrarchism</i> for Monday. In class, we will try to consolidate some of the observations we made in class on Wednesday with a lecture on the Early Modern sonnet and the function of the poetic <span class="key">conceit</span>.

Optional reading: <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342848">"On the Margins of Discourse"</a> by Barbara Herrnstein Smith. This is referenced in the definition of "fiction" in Greene's book and is a very clear, interesting read.

This week we pay closer attention to notions like "voice," "address," and "dialogue" in order to better understand these longer poems work. We will also continue to apply the concepts encountered last week: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, and ask ourselves which of these terms seem most helpful.
</p>
<p>Oct 5 - John Ashbery, &ldquo;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror&rdquo;</p>
<ul class="descript">
<li> Read p. 68-76 of the Ashbery poem.
<li> Then write a comment in <span class="slack">#ashbery</span> on a segment of the poem which felt particularly vivid, present, or clear to you and one which felt vague, abstract, or confusing. Does identifying deictics or finding instances of the four parameters at work change your understanding of that segment? Do this by 21:00 on Sunday.
<li> Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/present-waking-life">Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery</a>. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you're having trouble with Ashbery.
<li> You may also want to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigianino#/media/File:Parmigianino_Selfportrait.jpg">Parmigianino painting</a> referred to in the poem's title.</ul>
<p>Oct 7 -  Ashbery cont., Marianne Moore, &ldquo;An Octopus&rdquo;</p>
<ul class="descript">
<li> Read the rest of "Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror" (76-83).
<li> Begin reading "An Octopus." Add to <span class="slack">#moore</span> an excerpt from the poem that stands out to you as either especially compelling or especially confusing; connect it to one of the terms we've covered last week.
<li> In class, we'll continue talking about our affective responses to different parts of the poems and how the various terms covered last week can help us better understand these responses.
<li> Some clarifications on the nature of the "ode" will be addressed today.
</ul>
<p>Oct 9 - Marianne Moore, &ldquo;An Octopus&rdquo;, T.S. Eliot, &ldquo;The Three Voices of Poetry&rdquo;</p>
<ul class="descript">
<li> Finish "An Octopus."
<li> Read the Eliot essay.
<li> Read the <a href="/docs/markup">markup guide,</a> and apply it to a page of "The Three Voices." Post that page to <span class="slack">#rhetoric</span> with a few comments on what you found.
<li> In class we'll see if you can identify instances of the first, second, and/or third voices in either Ashbery or Moore. During class, add to <span class="slack">#three-voices</span> a quote from the Eliot essay alongside a segment from either of the poems where you feel one of the three voices is particularly salient.</ul>

Start Essay 2. Focus on determining which term(s) you'd like to focus on and what type of essay you'd like to write: will you write about one poem in detail, or write about how multiple poems relate to any of the recently encountered concepts? Post the first two paragraphs; write them as if you were about to turn them in. Please do this by 21:00 on Sunday so I have time to look over them before class.

<p>Nov 6 - Politics in the Poem</p>
<p class="descript">
We will take a look at several post-9/11 poems and discuss the role of politics in the poem. Does political language change how you engage with poetry?

We will discuss the relationship between certain complex topics, political and scientific, and poetry's "value." Are all poems political? What is politics?

  <summary>Guidelines</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p>Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.</li>
<li>Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.</li>
<li>During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions for what to present:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poem-centric:</strong> Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you&rsquo;re interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.</li>
<li><strong>Essay-centric:</strong> Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Idea-centric:</strong> Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you&rsquo;d like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Class-centric:</strong> Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you&rsquo;re close to done with your essay and if you&rsquo;re one of the last presenters.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.</p>
