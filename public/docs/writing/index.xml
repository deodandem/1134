Prompt #  As we have discussed in class, lyric poems may be defined in terms of their “ritual” and “fictional” elements, in terms of their use of &amp;ldquo;deixis,&amp;rdquo; in terms of the &amp;ldquo;four parameters,&amp;rdquo; or in terms of the &amp;ldquo;three voices.&amp;rdquo; All of these terms ultimately help us discuss the simple question: &amp;ldquo;Who is speaking?</description>

      <description>Essay 4 - &amp;ldquo;Prompt&amp;rdquo; #  Due Wednesday, 5/19 at 22:00
Prompt #  Design your own prompt or recycle one of the previous three. You may choose to write on any poem or poet, even if you previously wrote about it. You can write an expanded version of a previous paper. The main difference between this essay and the prior ones is the length. With twice as much space, you are encouraged to do some &amp;ldquo;research,&amp;rdquo; meaning that you may write about multiple poems, connect the poems to historical background, compare the work of two different poets, connect the poems to art in another genre, or use a poetic framework not discussed in class.</description>
