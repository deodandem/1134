  Prompt

</h3>
<p>Design your own prompt or recycle one of the previous three. You may choose to write on any poem or poet, even if you previously wrote about it. You can write an expanded version of a previous paper. The main difference between this essay and the prior ones is the length. With twice as much space, you are encouraged to do some &ldquo;research,&rdquo; meaning that you may write about multiple poems, connect the poems to historical background, compare the work of two different poets, connect the poems to art in another genre, or use a poetic framework not discussed in class.</p>
<h3 id="suggestions">
  Suggestions
  <a class="anchor" href="#suggestions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expand Essay 3 by incorporating more research in your discussion of the poem&rsquo;s &ldquo;studium&rdquo; and more personal reflection in your discussion of the poem&rsquo;s &ldquo;punctum.&rdquo; Or, expand Essay 1 or 2 by discussing how multiple poems use line, meter, deixis, fictionality, the three voices, or the four parameters in different ways.</li>
<li>Write a poem in response to another author&rsquo;s poem and write about the choices you made as you composed and revised it. Reflect on how this creative act has deepened your understanding of that poem or of your own values. You may wish to reconstruct and respond to the author&rsquo;s ethos, compositional practices, or a topic addressed in their poetry.</li>
<li>Translate a poem into English and write about your choices and any research you did in order to make these choices.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s say you want to publish a small anthology of poems. To begin, choose three poems and make an argument for how they fit into your anthology.</li>
<li>Write an essay discussing the relationship between a poem and a non-poem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specifications">
  Specifications
  <a class="anchor" href="#specifications">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>8-12 pages, 1.7 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style</li>
<li>Grade: 40%. Rubric will be released a week in advance.</li>
<li>Submit: On Canvas as PDF; include poem(s) in Appendix</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grading">
  Grading
  <a class="anchor" href="#grading">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I will provide an assessment at the draft stage based on the following items:</p>
<ol style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Argument <br>
    <i>Is the argument easy to follow? Is the argument interesting? By "interesting" I mean falsifiable and somewhat unexpectedâ€”the reader will not want to read about something that seems obviously true.</i>
<li> Language <br>
    <i>Clarity, simplicity, and concision are preferred, but vibrant, complex, eclectic language is often necessary when dealing with poetic materials. You may have to do some work to find the right words to describe something. Use contrasts to your advantage. Longer sentences are punctuated by shorter ones. Objective language is interwoven with subjective language, etc.</i>
<li> Typography <br>
    <i>Lack of typos, adherence to MLA formatting rules, quality of sources. Very important as many of your future professors, employers, and peers will glance at your work and not take it seriously if they immediately find "careless" mistakes. Guard yourself against bias!</i>
</ol>
<p>The final grade is based on the rationale outlined in &ldquo;Process.&rdquo; The letters will be converted to numerical percentages following the standard grading scale, and weighted as 40% of the final grade.</p>
<ul style="margin-left:3em">
<li> A: The essay produces intrigue at the outset and impels the reader to follow through from beginning to end. Suggested revisions are minor, rare, and could be fixed in a few minutes; they are more accidental than systematic.
<li> A-: ---. Suggested revisions are minor but systematic, and impede what would otherwise be a very interesting and pleasurable reading experience.
<li> B+: An argument is explicitly stated, but the paper does not follow through effectively its body paragraphs. Issues of language at the sentence level are minor or accidental and could be fixed quickly and easily.
<li> B: ---. Issues of language at the sentence level are fairly minor but systematic.
<li> B-: ---. Issues of language at the sentence level are widespread and significantly obscure the reading process.
<li> C-range: Paper lacks an argument and is difficult to follow due to issues with language at the sentence level.
<li> F: Was not turned in, or was completely unrelated to course content.
</ul>
<h3 id="looking-ahead">
  Looking Ahead
  <a class="anchor" href="#looking-ahead">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Being able to design your own prompt or expand on previous work is an essential skill for future research, where you will be responsible for framing the parameters of your own project. I hope this class also gives you some tools for reading poems and other kinds of textsâ€”visual, musical, etc.â€”and learning from them.</p>
