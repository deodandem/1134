<ul>
<li>Choose a poem and think about how it employs rhyme or repetition. Take notes on what you observe.</li>
<li>Choose a poem and think about how its lineation relates to its meaning. Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? How is enjambment used in the poem? How long are the lines, and what are their syntactic components? Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that stand out to you? Do these groupings form archetypal patterns like call-and-response or syllogism? Here&rsquo;s a relevant quote from Hass:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.<br>    The sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox. (11)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Choose a poem and read it out loud. Determine which excerpts of the poem appeal to you most, and scan them. See if you notice any patterns in the meter which relate to the meaning or other aspects of your favorite lines (which may include syntax, for instance). Here&rsquo;s one inspirational quote from Hass—</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The work of prosody in free verse, as in metrical verse, comes once the poem is under way. The twos and threes, or the fours and threes and then fours; the choice of making stanzas or not making stanzas, what kind of line endings—that work. You are hearing a poem that is grave and slow, or charged and relentless, or hesitant, or easy and fluid, the sense of sound, arc of development, play with undevelopment, image- or thought-cascade occurring and telling you what it wants to be, form and content beginning to be a body. The final form exactly right, or not—seeming just okay, adequate to the task, but not radiant, not the radiance. (428)</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">——</div>
<p><b><i>Then,</i></b>
write an essay which convinces a reader of the poem that paying attention to your formal object of your analysis (rhyme, lineation, meter) can deepen their appreciation of the poem.</p>
<h3 id="further-instructions">

</h3>
<ol style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Your essay should demonstrate clear intent to respond to the prompt: it should help the reader see why your analysis of rhyme, lineation, or meter are worth embarking on.
<li> Cite a secondary text to frame your argument or to provide a specific definition of the terms you are using (rhyme, repetition, line-groupings, meter, etc.) Since these are big concepts, your definition will necessarily be partial, so you should make that clear.
<li> The introduction should give us a good sense of why you chose the poem and why you are focusing on a particular form or motif within it. You may do this by giving context (what is the poem about, what is its form, who wrote it, when, etc.), providing a few "teasers" (favorite quotes from the poem), providing material from a secondary source, and/or including a personal anecdote which frames your motivations.
<li> The final paragraph should reflect on how successful your analysis was and whether there were any points deliberately left out for the sake of concision. What are some possible routes for further inquiry, and which seem most promising to you?
<li> When making a general claim, remind the reader of precisely what you are referring to by quoting directly from the text. If you're writing about meter, denote meter-markings below a quoted line from a poem using u (unstressed) and ' (stressed) to denote the syllables. Separate feet, if applicable, using / or // for a caesura.
<li> Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible.
<li> Sentences should flow well, meaning that they should employ contrasts in sentence length and structure to help the reader stay engaged; you should also edit out any unwanted repetitions of words or phrases.
<li> If a sentence leads into digressive or speculative territory, there should be a clear justification for this maneuver.
<li> Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially prepositions and verbs.
<li> Use the proper tense (mostly present) and person (mostly first and third). Avoid the pronoun "it" unless the antecedent is clear, <u>avoid the passive voice where an active verb would work instead. A good way to check for this is to search for the verbs "is/has/has been" in your paper.</u>
<li> Include proper in-text citations (including citations of line numbers).
<li> Transcribe the poem and include it in the Appendix of your paper (before the Works Cited page). If it is more than 14 lines long but less than 50, then you should include line numbers (copying the poem into a table with invisible cell lines is a good way to do this). If it is much longer, you can refer to page numbers rather than lines. The template on Canvas may be helpful.
<li> The body of the paper should be around 4 pages, with a descriptive title, MLA formatting, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page.

<p>This exercise will help you identify an important formal element of poetry, and will also require you to provide a description of a poem&rsquo;s meaning. The process of connecting structural patterns to your impressions of a poem&rsquo;s overall insights will prepare you for future essays in this course.</p>
