Office Hours  Welcome to Fall 2020! #  COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS) #  Poems are puzzles, or are they plants? In this class, we will respond to key questions like &amp;ldquo;How does this poem work?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why do I like it?&amp;rdquo; Poems are often thought of as infinite in the possibilities of perception and wonder they produce. We will grapple with the paradox of writing about poetry in a closed, concise form without domesticating it, by investigating how reading poetry can teach us how to write anew.</description>
