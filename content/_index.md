## COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS)                      

**Instructor: Didi Chang-Park (he/him); dp625; <a href="https://calendly.com/dp625">Office Hours</a>**

Poems are puzzles, or are they plants? In this class, we will respond to key questions like "How does this poem work?" or "Why do I like it?" Poems are often thought of as infinite in the possibilities of perception and wonder they produce. We will grapple with the paradox of writing about poetry in a closed, concise form without domesticating it, by investigating how reading poetry can teach us how to write anew. How are lines and stanzas related to sentences and paragraphs? Can ideas "rhyme?" Are notions such as deixis, voice, metaphor, apostrophe, prosody, and the "lyric I" essential to producing a cogent and truthful argument in any discipline?

## Learning Outcomes
<div style="margin-left:2em">

### Method
This course is focused on developing skills for reading poetry in a close and systematic fashion. We will be covering annotation methods and exercises that can be used to discover the structures, patterns, meaning, and linguistic innovation present in poems. These “empirical” techniques are relevant to any kind observation, field work, note-taking, or imaginative endeavor necessary to success in other fields of inquiry.

### Theory
Humans have developed a diverse range of terms used to point out and describe phenomena in poetic language. We will be learning to use some of these terms as tools. One broad question we will discuss is the definition of “lyric poetry,” and its relationship to the “ritual” and the “fictional.” This will in turn lead us to accumulate knowledge of various tropes and genres. Such an outcome is mainly useful to those of you planning on studying poetry beyond this course, so we will determine its weight based on student interest.

### Invention
We will regularly work on transforming the thoughts, ideas, and discussions we have in class into writing; these are artifacts will give you a sense of how your ideas have developed over time and provide a foothold for improving your sensitivity to and appreciation of class materials and external phenomena. Moreover, you will learn to make writing into an active, social phenomenon, in which you are in conversation with yourself, poetry, your peers, and other scholars. The essay assignments in this class are meant to guide you to writing a final paper that feels genuine and valuable to your life.
