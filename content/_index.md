## COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS)                      

Poems are puzzles, or are they plants? In this class, we will respond to key questions like "How does this poem work?" or "Why do I like it?" Poems are often thought of as infinite in the possibilities of perception and wonder they produce. We will grapple with the paradox of writing about poetry in a closed, concise form without domesticating it, by investigating how reading poetry can teach us how to write anew. How are lines and stanzas related to sentences and paragraphs? Can ideas "rhyme?" Are notions such as deixis, voice, metaphor, apostrophe, prosody, and the "lyric I" essential to producing a cogent and truthful argument in any discipline?

## Learning Outcomes
<div style="margin-left:2em">

### Method
This course is focused on developing skills for attentive reading. We will carry out exercises that make reading an enjoyable and dynamic process that can be used to discover the structures, patterns, meaning, and linguistic innovation in poems. Such an observational acumen is crucial to success in other fields.

### Theory
We will discuss the definition of “lyric poetry,” and its relationship to various “ritual” and “fictional” elements. Being able to define and identify poetic elements accurately and precisely will allow you to more fully appreciate how individual poems innovate or diverge from pre-established traditions.

### Writing
Writing is revising, and the best revisions arise from collaborative efforts. You will learn to approach writing as a kind of dialogue with yourself, poems, poets, peers, scholars, and the world. The essay sequence is meant to guide you toward writing a final paper that is much more meaningful and surprising than anything you could have accomplished in isolation.

The final version of each assignment prompt will be available at least one week in advance of the due date. Listed page counts are useful guidelines, but you may write more if it feels important to do so.
Essays should follow <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html">MLA citation and style guidelines,</a> with Times New Roman font and 1.5 line spacing. Turn in all papers as PDFs on Canvas. Submit a copy of the poem in the front matter of your paper (see template on Canvas). Separately attach a voice recording of you reading the poem. Your recitation is not going to be evaluated, but may be helpful for observing aspects of a poem that are not apparent through silent reading.


## Course Materials

All readings will be made available on Canvas or linked to the schedule at least a week in advance. If you are looking for a resource not on the syllabus that is unavailable at the library, let me know, and I will try to help.

Since many poems are digitized and access to printing is limited, you must bring electronic devices to class for the sake of viewing PDFs or ebooks.

You are encouraged to purchase one or two books in hard copy, especially from Abebooks, Powell's, or the local Buffalo Street Books. While electronic books have their benefits, the physical book encourages casual encounters with random pages and invites rereading.

Tablets are highly recommended for marking up texts and tend to be more conducive to focused reading.

## Grading

The minimum expected grade, B- will be given to those who
1. Miss no more than three classes*
2. Participate in all class activities
3. Complete all assignments on time**

Grades above this depend on quality of essay assignments. Essays 1-3 count for 20% each, Essay 5 counts for 40%. Essay 0 is purely diagnostic and not graded. See individual rubrics for each essay as they are released for exact grading criteria.

Numerical scale: 98-100% (A+), 93-97% (A), 90-92% (A-), 88-89% (Β+), 83-87% (B), …

*&nbsp;Being more than 15 minutes late to class counts as an absence. Being more than 5 minutes late three times counts as an absence. Absences beyond three will not negatively affect your grade if they are due to a medical emergency or quarantine mandate.

** Essays must respond to the prompt to receive credit. I cannot give credit for essays turned in more than 48 hours late, with the exception of Essay 5, for which you may request a personalized due date. Adhering to deadlines will help you deal with even more stringent deadlines in other classes and life situations.

## Zoom

If you need to access class online, reference the Canvas "Zoom" tab for access. Do not share the Zoom meeting information with outside parties. Keep your camera on, as it improves the quality of conversation. Mute your microphone when not speaking.
