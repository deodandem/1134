### Week 1: Sept 2, 4 – Introduction

9/2: Introduction: What is Reading?
<p class="descript">
What's your relationship to reading? What does it feel like to read different kinds of texts: news articles, long-form journalism, poetry, fiction, code, mathematical proofs, tweets, emails?</p>

9/4: Selections from 9/2
<p class="descript">
Make the introduction post to the Discussion Board.<br>
We will continue with poems on the slides from Day 1.<br>  
Come to class with questions about the syllabus or schedule.

{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}

2. Did you have trouble hearing the instructor or classmates?
3. Ask any questions you may have about the course syllabus/schedule. I will respond next class. </p>

<span class="yellow">Essay 0 - "First Day" (Due 9/7, 22:00)</span>


### Week 2: Sept 7, 9, 11 – Objects

9/7: Gertrude Stein, "Susie Asado" (p. 125), "Repetition" (PE[^*], 1168)
<p class="descript">
What's the role of <u>repetition</u> in Stein's poetry?<br>
Does the <u>meaning</u> of each word "matter"?<br>
<i>Poetics</i> vs. <i>hermeneutics</i><br>
Poetry + {song, painting, science, politics}
</p>

9/9: Gertrude Stein, *Tender Buttons*, Harryette Mullen, [*Recyclopedia*](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/5966641)
<p class="descript">
Read as much of <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> in <i>Recyclopedia</i> as you can. Focus on <q>Roastbeef</q> in <i>Tender Buttons,</i> explore whatever else catches your eye. Mullen's <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> directly corresponds to Stein's &ldquo;Food&rdquo; section of <i>Tender Buttons.</i> How does it differentiate itself from its source of inspiration?
</p>

9/11: Francis Ponge, "The Carnation" ("L'œillet"), excerpts from *Unfinished Ode to Mud,* Andrew Epstein,["The Rhapsody of Things as They Are"](http://www.jstor.com/stable/44885307)

<p class="descript">
Let's try to identify specific rhetorical patterns, techniques, and tropes in Ponge&rsquo;s writing which we might employ in our own.
</p>
<p class="descript">

</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" open >}}
<p class = "descript">
Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a "template text" to roughly define its length.</p>

<ul class="descript">
  <li> Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, use verbless noun phrases, re-invent words...
  <li> Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English, ...
  <li> Stein: Consider the use of repetition, homonyms, ungrammatical constructions, ...
</ul>
<p class = "descript">
  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet's style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.
</p>

### Week 3: Sept 14, 16, 18 – Line

9/14: Robert Hass: Preface, Chapter 1, 2, from *A Little Book on Form*
<p class="descript">
Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous readings, or in poems you have independently found. Hass gives many poem recommendations, and you may find it helpful to look up some of the ones he only quotes excerpts from. Try to figure out why you like a given line of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?
</p>

9/16: Whitman, "Song of Myself"; Hass: Ch 3

<p class="descript">
What stanza lengths are you finding? Is there a logic to these numbers? Continue to keep a list of favorite lines.
</p>

9/18: A.R. Ammons: Corsons Inlet, Hass: Ch 4

<p class="descript">
Pay attention to numerical units in this poem. How might the lines be grouped? How does the lineation relate to the motion of thought represented in the poem?
</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}
<p class="descript">
Share the poem you will be writing about for Essay 1. First write about what you notice (this does not have to be about the lineation of the poem). Then share a quote from the Hass reading you'd like to reference in the essay. You do not have to make an argument about how that quote on lineation relates to what you noticed (that's for you to elaborate in the essay). Post by Sunday at 22:00; read what your classmates have written over the course of the following week. </p>

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach by reading a wide range of sonnets today by Rilke, Donne, Petrarch, Toomer, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Shakespeare, etc. Ask yourself: What do sonnets do? What makes this form so robust?
</p>

9/23: Selected sonnets (cont.)

</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}

### Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations

{{< details Guidelines open>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
