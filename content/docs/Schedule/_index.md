# COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS)

### Week 1: Feb 8, 10, 12 – Introduction
<p class="descript">
This week we will read and respond to five poems. What do you notice in each?
</p>

2/8: Introduction
<p class="descript">
Today we discuss what "reading" and "poetry" mean to you.<br>
Be sure to complete the preliminary survey by 10 PM!
</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, hometown, prospective major, anything else you'd like to share) and write a brief reflection on your FWS experience last semester. What did you write about in your final essay? How was the experience overall? Was there anything about the course design that worked particularly well for you? What would you change if you could go back in time? What do you hope to work on in this course? <u>Post by today, 2/8 at 22:00.</u>
{{< /hint >}}


2/10: Continuation
<p class="descript">
We will start discussing two poems from the slides: "A Light and Diplomatic Bird" by Gwendolyn Brooks, and "Hello, the Roses" by Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge. What do you notice?<br>


<span class="yellow">Essay 0 - "First Day" (Due 2/12, 22:00)</span>

<span class="yellow">Essay 0 - Peer review (Due 2/14, 22:00)</span>


### Week 2: Feb 15, 17, 19 – Rhyme

2/15: "Susie Asado," "Rhyme" (PEPP), "Repetition" (PEPP)
<p class="descript">
Discussion of Stein's poem, and how to scan through reference sources for key information.

2/17: "Shearing the Sheep"
<p class="descript">
An exercise in poetry composition. Our topic is fear. Our formal constraint is rhyme. But how do we go from vague ideas and various rules to an actual written text? Using rhymezone, the dictionary, and crowdsourced ideas about fear and related words, we'll attempt to write a poem together.

2/19: Harryette Mullen, Christian Bök, R.A.P. Ferreira, Eminem
<p class="descript">
Discussion of rhyme and repetition in written and oral poetries. Discussion will likely include: Alexander Pope, Gertrude Stein, R.A.P. Ferreira, Eminem, Wally McRae, Harryette Mullen, and Christian Bök.


</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Think about our discussions of rhyme and repetition this week and identify an idea you would like to respond to. Then, find an excerpt from the PEPP entries or a poem which addresses that idea. Finally, write a poem responding to that quotation. Here's a topical constraint: <i>Write about something you fear.</i> You may certainly begin by writing your poem first, before connecting it to a particular idea on rhyme/repetition. Regardless, write a brief paragraph afterwards sharing the quote and reflecting on your process, and how satisfied you are with your response to the cited text. <u>Post by 2/20 at 22:00. <b>Upload your work as a PDF attachment to a DB post; follow MLA formatting and citation rules.</b></u>
{{< /hint >}}



### Week 3: Feb 22, 24, 26 – Line

2/22: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from *A Little Book on Form*
<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, put in the <span class="slack">#line</span> slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further).
<li>Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?
</ul>

2/24: Poems by Robert Hass and Louise Glück

2/26: Poems by A.R. Ammons and Walt Whitman


</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Draft a poem or a stanza from a poem. It could be an extension or revision of last week's post, or something new. Show four different ways of writing it on the page (using line breaks, stanza divisions, or virgules) and see if you can determine which one you prefer. Write a paragraph describing how you came up with the four arrangements and why you prefer the chosen one over the others. Cite Hass or another poem where necessary. <u>Post by 2/27 at 22:00. <b>Upload your work as a PDF attachment to the DB post; follow MLA formatting and citation rules.</b></u>

### Week 5: Mar 8, 10, 12 – Sonnet

<span class="blue" style="margin-left:0em">**Individual Conference I**</span>
{{< hint warning >}}
In this conference, I will give you feedback on Essay 1. The earlier you schedule it, the more time you have to work on revisions. The final deadline for revisions is 3/19, 22:00, but if you turn them in earlier and request it, I can provide additional rounds of feedback. You may also come up with other questions or topics to discuss during the conference.
{{< /hint >}}

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>

3/8: *Art of the Sonnet,* selected entries
<p class="descript">
    We'll try to "mine" some of these entries for ideas on how to write.

3/10: No Class

3/12: Baroque Sonnets
<p class="descript">
    Read the Introduction (p. 5-25) from <i>Art of the Sonnet.</i>


### Week 6: Mar 15, 17, 19 – Sonnet, cont.
<p class="descript">
This week we pay closer attention to notions like "voice," "address," and "dialogue" in order to better understand these longer poems work. We will also continue to apply the concepts encountered last week: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, and ask ourselves which of these terms seem most helpful.
</p>

Does identifying deictics or finding instances of the four parameters at work change your understanding of that segment? Do this by 21:00 on Sunday.
<li> Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/present-waking-life">Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery</a>. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you're having trouble with Ashbery.

### Week 14: May 3, 5, 7 — Presentations

{{< details Guidelines close>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
