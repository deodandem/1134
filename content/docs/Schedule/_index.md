### Week 1: Feb 8, 10, 12 – Introduction
<p class="descript">

<p class="descript">
Today we discuss what "reading" and "poetry" mean to you.<br>
Be sure to complete the preliminary survey by 10 PM!
</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, hometown, prospective major, anything else you'd like to share) and write a brief reflection on your FWS experience last semester. What did you write about in your final essay? How was the experience overall? Was there anything about the course design that worked particularly well for you? What would you change if you could go back in time? What do you hope to work on in this course? <u>Post by today, 2/8 at 22:00.</u>
{{< /hint >}}

### Week 2: Feb 15, 17, 19 – Rhyme

2/15: "Susie Asado," "Rhyme" (PEPP), "Repetition" (PEPP)
<p class="descript">
Discussion of Stein's poem, and how to scan through reference sources for key information.

2/17: "Shearing the Sheep"
<p class="descript">
An exercise in poetry composition. Our topic is fear. Our formal constraint is rhyme. But how do we go from vague ideas and various rules to an actual written text? Using rhymezone, the dictionary, and crowdsourced ideas about fear and related words, we'll attempt to write a poem together.

2/19: Harryette Mullen, Christian Bök, R.A.P. Ferreira, Eminem
<p class="descript">
Discussion of rhyme and repetition in written and oral poetries. Discussion will likely include: Alexander Pope, Gertrude Stein, R.A.P. Ferreira, Eminem, Wally McRae, Harryette Mullen, and Christian Bök.


</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Think about our discussions of rhyme and repetition this week and identify an idea you would like to respond to. Then, find an excerpt from the PEPP entries or a poem which addresses that idea. Finally, write a poem responding to that quotation. Here's a topical constraint: <i>Write about something you fear.</i> You may certainly begin by writing your poem first, before connecting it to a particular idea on rhyme/repetition. Regardless, write a brief paragraph afterwards sharing the quote and reflecting on your process, and how satisfied you are with your response to the cited text. <u>Post by 2/20 at 22:00. <b>Upload your work as a PDF attachment to a DB post; follow MLA formatting and citation rules.</b></u>
{{< /hint >}}



### Week 3: Feb 22, 24, 26 – Line

2/22: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from *A Little Book on Form*
<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, put in the <span class="slack">#line</span> slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further).
<li>Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?
</ul>

2/24: Poems by Robert Hass and Louise Glück

2/26: Poems by A.R. Ammons and Walt Whitman


</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Draft a poem or a stanza from a poem. It could be an extension or revision of last week's post, or something new. Show three different ways of writing it on the page (using line breaks, stanza divisions, or virgules) and see if you can determine which one you prefer. Write a paragraph describing how you came up with the three arrangements and why you prefer the chosen one over the others. Cite Hass or another poem where necessary. <u>Post by 2/27 at 22:00. <b>Upload your work as a PDF attachment to the DB post; follow MLA formatting and citation rules.</b></u>

### Week 5: Mar 8, 10, 12 – Sonnet

<span class="blue" style="margin-left:0em">**Individual Conference I**</span>
{{< hint warning >}}
In this conference, I will give you feedback on Essay 1. The earlier you schedule it, the more time you have to work on revisions. The final deadline for revisions is 3/19, 22:00, but if you turn them in earlier and request it, I can provide additional rounds of feedback. You may also come up with other questions or topics to discuss during the conference.
{{< /hint >}}

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>

3/8: *Art of the Sonnet,* selected sonnets
<p class="descript">
    Read the Introduction (p. 5-25) from <i>Art of the Sonnet.</i> Start reading poems from the Sonnet Reader; post poems that catch your eye in <span class="slack">#sonnet</span>. We'll pick out some quotes from the AoS Intro and look at some poems in the Sonnet reader in class. A few questions we will address: Why 14 lines? Why these rhyme schemes? Why and how did this form emerge? What are common topics addressed by the sonnet? What are its rhetorical stances and social, political, and/or aesthetic functions?

3/10: No Class

3/12: Early Modern Sonnets
<p class="descript">
    Continue posting sonnets in <span class="slack">#sonnet</span>, particularly those from the 19th-21st centuries. We will discuss the Early Modern sonnets (e.g., Petrarch, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Sor Juana) and look at some associated paintings. Why are death and eros such common topics, and how do these poets approach them?
    


### Week 6: Mar 15, 17, 19 – Sonnet, cont.
<p class="descript">

<p class="descript">
We will also discuss and apply terms from the theory readings in class.

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Pick a sonnet or ghazal and discuss its relationship with another poem of the same form. See if you can relate the poems with one of the concepts we learned in class, from the theoretical readings of the Encyclopedia. Your comparison may relate to the poems' differing takes on a similar topic, their enunciative apparati, the degree to which they are "hyperbolic," differing uses of ritual and fictional elements, and/or their respective takes on a similar conceit. <u>Post by 3/21 at 22:00.</u>
{{< /hint >}}

### Week 7: Mar 22, 24, 26 – Ode
This week we pay closer attention to notions like "voice," "address," and "dialogue" in order to better understand these longer poems work. We will also continue to apply the concepts encountered last week: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, and ask ourselves which of these terms seem most helpful.

### Week 13: May 3, 5, 7 — Characters (Presentations)

{{< details Guidelines close>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
