# COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS)

### Week 1: Feb 8, 10, 12 – Introduction

2/8: Introduction
<p class="descript">
This week we will read and respond to five poems. What do you notice in each?
</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, hometown, prospective major, anything else you'd like to share) and write a brief reflection on your FWS experience last semester. What did you write about in your final essay? How was the experience overall? Was there anything about the course design that worked particularly well for you? What would you change if you could go back in time? What do you hope to work on in this course? <u>Post by today, 2/8 at 22:00.</u>
{{< /hint >}}

</p>

{{< hint db >}}
**Discussion Board** — Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently. Write in sonnet form, using monovocalic constraints, or create an evocative sonic landscape which doesn't put primacy on semantic content. <u>Post by 2/20 at 22:00.</u>
{{< /hint >}}



### Week 3: Feb 22, 24, 26 – Line

2/22: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from *A Little Book on Form*
<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, put in the <span class="slack">#line</span> slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further).
<li>Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?
</ul>

2/24: Selected poems by Robert Hass and A.R. Ammons

2/26: Selected poems by Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge
<p class="descript">

</p>


### Week 4: Mar 1, 3, 5 – Meter

<span class="yellow">Essay 1 "Line, Rhyme, Meter" (Due 3/5, 22:00)</span>
<p class="descript", style="margin-top:-.5em">


3/1: Hass: "A Note on Stress," "How to Scan a Poem"

3/3: Whitman, "Song of Myself"
    
3/5: Mini-Presentations


### Week 5: Mar 8, 10, 12 – Sonnet

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>

3/8: Sonnet reader, *Art of the Sonnet,* Introduction (p. 5-25)
<p class="descript">
Before class, take a look at the sonnets in the reader. Choose a sonnet to share in the <span class="slack">#sonnet</span> channel. You may give general impressions and write about its meter, rhyme, or line groupings.
</p>

3/10: No Class

3/12: *Post-Petrarchism,* Introduction (p. 1-13) and Chapter 1 (p. 22-27)


### Week 6: Mar 15, 17, 19 – Ode
<p class="descript">
This week we pay closer attention to notions like "voice," "address," and "dialogue" in order to better understand these longer poems work. We will also continue to apply the concepts encountered last week: ritual, fiction, deixis, the four parameters, and ask ourselves which of these terms seem most helpful.
</p>

3/15: Fictive Utterances

<ul class="descript">
    <li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342848">"On the Margins of Discourse"</a> by Barbara Herrnstein Smith. This is referenced in the definition of "fiction" in Greene's book and is a very clear, interesting read.
    <li> T.S. Eliot, "The Three Voices of Poetry"
</ul>

3/17 - John Ashbery, "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror"

<ul class="descript">
<li> Read p. 68-76 of the Ashbery poem.
<li> Then write a comment in <span class="slack">#ashbery</span> on a segment of the poem which felt particularly vivid, present, or clear to you and one which felt vague, abstract, or confusing. Does identifying deictics or finding instances of the four parameters at work change your understanding of that segment? Do this by 21:00 on Sunday.
<li> Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/present-waking-life">Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery</a>. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you're having trouble with Ashbery.
<li> You may also want to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigianino#/media/File:Parmigianino_Selfportrait.jpg">Parmigianino painting</a> referred to in the poem's title.</ul>


3/19 - Marianne Moore, "An Octopus"

### Week 7: Mar 22, 24, 26 – Reading Others Reading

<p class="descript">
In preparation for Essay 2, we'll work through some essays on the poems we read last week, or on the theoretical texts we previously read, searching for rhetorical strategies, argumentative structures, and sentence forms that we can use in our own writing.
</p>

3/22 - Ashbery + Moore
<p class = "descript">
Pick one of the following articles to read and mark up. Reivew the <a href="/docs/markup">markup guide</a> for some directions on what to look for and how to do this.

### Week 14: May 3, 5, 7 — Presentations

{{< details Guidelines close>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
