### Week 1: Sept 2, 4 – Introduction

{{< expand "What do you notice?" >}}

9/2: Introduction
<p class="descript">
What's your relationship to reading? What does it feel like to read different kinds of texts? This week we will read five poems by A.R. Ammons, Christian Bök, H.D., Reginald Shepherd, and Juliana Spahr. What do you notice in each?
</p>

9/4: Selections from 9/2
<p class="descript">

### Week 2: Sept 7, 9, 11 – Objects


<span class="blue" style="margin-left:0em">**Individual Conference I**</span>

{{< expand "How does it mean?" >}}

9/7: Gertrude Stein, "Susie Asado" (p. 125), "Repetition" (PEPP, 1168)
<p class="descript">
What's the role of <u>repetition</u> in Stein's poetry?<br>
Does the <u>meaning</u> of each word "matter"?<br>
<i>Poetics</i> vs. <i>hermeneutics</i><br>
Poetry + {song, painting, science, politics}
</p>

9/9: Gertrude Stein, *Tender Buttons*, Harryette Mullen, [*Recyclopedia*](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/5966641)
<p class="descript">
Read as much of <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> in <i>Recyclopedia</i> as you can. Focus on <q>Roastbeef</q> in <i>Tender Buttons,</i> explore whatever else catches your eye. Mullen's <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> directly corresponds to Stein's &ldquo;Food&rdquo; section of <i>Tender Buttons.</i> How does it differentiate itself from its source of inspiration?
</p>

9/11: Francis Ponge, "The Carnation" ("L'œillet"), excerpts from *Unfinished Ode to Mud,* Andrew Epstein,["The Rhapsody of Things as They Are"](http://www.jstor.com/stable/44885307)

<p class="descript">
Let's try to identify specific rhetorical patterns, techniques, and tropes in Ponge&rsquo;s writing which we might employ in our own.
</p>
<p class="descript">

</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" open >}}
<p class = "descript">
Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a "template text" to roughly define its length.</p>

<ul class="descript">
  <li> Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, or write a "scrambled" set of poems that use similar phrases in different order.
  <li> Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English. Try to use registers of speech or "found linguistic materials" (like stuff from a COVID-related news report?)...
  <li> Stein: Write something highly repetitive and rhythmic, using words that sonically bring to mind the object in question without denoting it directly.
  <li> Fourth option: don't copy any of the poets consciously, just write about an object. Then add a paragraph of commentary afterwards on how you feel your poetics relates to the past week's poets—are you doing something completely different? Are there any similarities?
</ul>
<p class = "descript">
  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet's style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.
</p>

### Week 3: Sept 14, 16, 18 – Line and Meter

{{< expand "Meaning ↔ Primary structures? " >}}

9/14: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from *A Little Book on Form*
<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, put in the <span class="slack">#line</span> slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further).
<li>Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?
</ul>

9/16: Whitman, "Song of Myself"; Hass: "A Note on Stress," "How to Scan a Poem"

<p class="descript">
Prior to class, keep a list of favorite lines from Whitman, adding to the <span class="slack">#whitman</span> channel one excerpt that you are particularly drawn to, with or without commentary by Tuesday at 22:00. You might want to scan it and discuss what you find. Also put one excerpt from the Hass reading in the <span class="slack">#meter</span> channel by Tuesday night.
</p>

9/18: Whitman cont., A.R. Ammons: Corsons Inlet; Hass: "How Free Verse Works"

<p class="descript">

<ul class="descript">
<li> Prior to class, make a post in the <span class="slack">#freeverse</span> channel. Comment on how <span class="key">line</span> groupings and/or <span class="key">meter</span> function in some excerpt of A.R. Ammons's "Corsons Inlet" or Robert Hass's "Meditation at Lagunitas" relate to your more immediate reaction to the poem's expression. Post by Thursday @ 22:00. Earlier is better!
<li> After class, start looking at the Sonnet reader and begin drafting your discussion board post, which is essentially a draft or proposal for Essay 1, "Line."
</ul>
</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" open >}}
<p class="descript">
Pick a poem to write about for Essay 1 (Links to an external site.). I suggest you choose any of the poems we've read so far, especially one you've written a comment on, or any sonnet* from the Sonnet Reader (117-sonnets.pdf). As with all future assignments, you're free to find something else on your own.</p>

<p class="descript">
First write about what you notice, with regards to the meaning or expressive effects of the poem. Then scan it and look for stanzas or line groupings** that stand out to you. Comment on any interesting patterns you find and try to connect these observations with your earlier observations on meaning/expression. Finally, ask a question or make a comment on how your post could be further developed. Post by Sunday at 22:00.</p>

<p class="descript">
*If you want to write on a sonnet that's not originally in English, you may want to focus on line groupings, or otherwise do a bit of research on how that language is supposed to be scanned.
</p>

<p class="descript">
**If you're dealing with a poem that has no obvious 1/2/3/4-line divisions or metrical pattern (i.e. Corsons Inlet) you should still try to identify the "ghosts" of these structures. Remember that trying to impose a rule or structure on a poem and then failing will help you see precisely where and how it exceeds those boundaries/expectations. Merely stating that a poem does not fit into categories is not enough to make this truth sufficiently vivid. You can be candid about the fact that an experiment or methodology is not the best fit for a poem in your writing, and choose not to use it at all in future essays, but for the purposes of this upcoming essay I'd like you to try your best to use "meter" and "line" as analytical categories.
</p>

<span class="yellow">Essay 1 "Line" (Due 9/25, 22:00)</span>
<p class="descript", style="margin-top:-.5em">Revisions, if needed, are due on October 7.</p>

### Week 4: Sept 21, 23, 25 – Sonnet

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach to the sonnet form this week by reading a wide range of sonnets by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, and others. Given these poems, we might ask: what do sonnets do? What subjects do they gravitate toward? What makes this form so robust and versatile?  A small "reader" has been uploaded on Canvas ( > Files > Sonnet > 129-sonnets.pdf ).
</p>

{{< expand "Why the sonnet?" >}}

9/21: Essay 1 Discussion, Sonnet reader
<p class="descript">
Before class, take a look at the sonnets in the reader. Choose a sonnet to share in the <span class="slack">#sonnet</span> channel. You may give general impressions and write about its meter, rhyme, or line groupings. In class we'll talk about the discussion board posts and upcoming essay, and then talk about some of your chosen sonnets.
</p>

9/23: Sonnet reader (cont.)
<p class="descript">
Please post to <span class="slack">#sonnet</span> prior to class. If you have already posted a sonnet, post another one. We'll continue talking about sonnets today, identifying common topics, trends in historical development, and variations in form (rhyme, cross-linguistic meter, length, stanza structure). We'll also do some reading exercises with the short essays from <i>Art of the Sonnet</i> to practice extracting key ideas quickly from secondary texts.
</p>


9/25: Sonnet reader (cont.) *Art of the Sonnet,* Introduction (p. 5-25)
<p class="descript">
Prior to class, focus on finishing Essay 1. If you have time, read the introduction of <i>Art of the Sonnet</i> and peruse some of the short essays on individual sonnets. When you're done, read the given page range of <i>Post-Petrarchism</i> for Monday. In class, we will try to consolidate some of the observations we made in class on Wednesday with a lecture on the Early Modern sonnet and the function of the poetic <span class="key">conceit</span>.

{{</ expand >}}


### Week 5: Sept 28, 30, Oct 2 – Sonnet

9/28: Sonnet reader (cont.) *Post-Petrarchism,* Introduction (p. 1-13)
<p class="descript">
Prior to class, read and take your own notes on <span class="key">ritual</span> and <span class="key">fiction</span> dimensions of a sonnet from the reader. We will discuss sonnets from the 19th century onward see how we can apply these concepts to various poems. We will also develop an understanding of how our previous discussions of line, meter, and conceit, relate to the two new terms.<br><br>
Optional reading: <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342848">"On the Margins of Discourse"</a> by Barbara Herrnstein Smith. This is referenced in the definition of "fiction" in Greene's book and is a very clear, interesting read.
</p>

9/30: Sonnet reader (cont.), *Post-Petrarchism,* Chapter 1 (p. 22-27)

<p class="descript">
Choose a sonnet and think about how it uses <span class="key">deixis</span> in an interesting manner. Bring your thoughts to class. We will see how we can apply deixis to various sonnets, and our focus will move beyond the individual poem to poems in sequences or groups.
</p>

10/2: Sonnet reader (cont.), *Theory of the Lyric*, Chapter 1 (p. 10-38)
<p class="descript">
Pay close attention to how the nine poems presented in the chapter are analyzed. Prior to class, choose a sonnet (or other poem); write a sentence or two in <span class="slack">#post-petrarchism</span> on how it involves <span class="key">deixis</span>, <span class="key">ritual and fiction</span>, and/or the <span class="key">four parameters</span> (enunciative-apparatus, being-event, re-performance, hyperbolic-risk). Please do this by 21:00. We will discuss what you have noted in class and reflect on the styles of argumentation/theorization that we've been exposed to thus far.
</p>

### Week 6: Oct 5, Oct 7, Oct 9 – Ode

<p class="descript">
This week we pay closer attention to the notion of "voice" or "address" in longer odes.
</p>

Oct 5 - T.S. Eliot, "The Three Voices of Poetry"; John Ashbery, "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror"

<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, read the Eliot essay.
<li>Read p. 68-73 of the Ashbery poem.
<li> Post an excerpt from either text to #three-voices or #ashbery with or without commentary.
<li> Optional: Larissa Macfarquhar, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/present-waking-life">Present Waking Life: Becoming John Ashbery</a>. A copy is on Canvas in case you hit a paywall. Helpful if you're having trouble with Ashbery.
<li> You may also want to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigianino#/media/File:Parmigianino_Selfportrait.jpg">Parmigianino painting</a> referred to in the poem's title.</ul>


Oct 7 - Ashbery cont.
<ul class="descript">
<li> Prior to class, read the rest of "Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror" (73-83).
<li> Then write a comment in #ashbery on a segment of the poem which felt particularly vivid, present, or clear to you and one which felt vague, abstract, or confusing. Then try to identify who the "speaker" is in those segments. Are you dealing with an instantiation of the first, second or third voice?
<li> We'll talk about our affective responses to different parts of the poem and how personal deictics and the notion of the there voices might help us understand these responses to the different parts of the poem.
</ul>

Oct 9 - Marianne Moore, "An Octopus"

Comment on a particular word or phrase that might be a "punctum" for you—choose any of this week's readings, or one of the previously discussed poems. Try to free associate (you can include personal associations) and don't worry too much about adhering to essayistic conventions. By now, you may have a pretty good idea of what poem(s) you will write about for the final paper, so it's best to write about that poem.
</p>
{{< /details >}}

### Week 9: Oct 26, 28, 30 – Attention

### Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations

{{< details Guidelines open>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
