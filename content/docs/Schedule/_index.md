# COML 1134: Reading Poetry (FWS)

### Week 1: Sept 2, 4 – Introduction

{{< expand "What do you notice?" >}}

9/2: Introduction
<p class="descript">
What's your relationship to reading? What does it feel like to read different kinds of texts? This week we will read five poems by A.R. Ammons, Christian Bök, H.D., Reginald Shepherd, and Juliana Spahr. What do you notice in each?
</p>

9/4: Selections from 9/2
<p class="descript">
Make the introduction post to the Discussion Board.<br>
We will continue with poems on the slides from Day 1.<br>  
Come to class with questions about the syllabus or schedule.

{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}
1. Name (what you would like to be called), pronouns, where you're from, something you like or are interested in that's not poetry.
2. Did you have trouble hearing the instructor or classmates?
3. Ask any questions you may have about the course syllabus/schedule. I will respond next class. </p>

### Week 2: Sept 7, 9, 11 – Objects


<span class="blue" style="margin-left:0em">**Individual Conference I**</span>

{{< expand "How does it mean?" >}}

9/7: Gertrude Stein, "Susie Asado" (p. 125), "Repetition" (PEPP, 1168)
<p class="descript">
What's the role of <u>repetition</u> in Stein's poetry?<br>
Does the <u>meaning</u> of each word "matter"?<br>
<i>Poetics</i> vs. <i>hermeneutics</i><br>
Poetry + {song, painting, science, politics}
</p>

9/9: Gertrude Stein, *Tender Buttons*, Harryette Mullen, [*Recyclopedia*](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/5966641)
<p class="descript">
Read as much of <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> in <i>Recyclopedia</i> as you can. Focus on <q>Roastbeef</q> in <i>Tender Buttons,</i> explore whatever else catches your eye. Mullen's <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> directly corresponds to Stein's &ldquo;Food&rdquo; section of <i>Tender Buttons.</i> How does it differentiate itself from its source of inspiration?
</p>

9/11: Francis Ponge, "The Carnation" ("L'œillet"), excerpts from *Unfinished Ode to Mud,* Andrew Epstein,["The Rhapsody of Things as They Are"](http://www.jstor.com/stable/44885307)

<p class="descript">
Let's try to identify specific rhetorical patterns, techniques, and tropes in Ponge&rsquo;s writing which we might employ in our own.
</p>
<p class="descript">

</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" open >}}
<p class = "descript">
Write a description of an everyday object or phenomenon that you've had direct experience with recently, using Gertrude Stein, Harryette Mullen, or Francis Ponge as a model. In order to do this effectively, identify one specific technique your poet uses and be sure to employ it in your piece. Use a "template text" to roughly define its length.</p>

<ul class="descript">
  <li> Ponge: You may want to develop small lexicons for words you associate with the object in question, or write a "scrambled" set of poems that use similar phrases in different order.
  <li> Mullen: Consider her use of colloquial idioms, especially those coming from advertising, vernacular English. Try to use registers of speech or "found linguistic materials" (like stuff from a COVID-related news report?)...
  <li> Stein: Write something highly repetitive and rhythmic, using words that sonically bring to mind the object in question without denoting it directly.
  <li> Fourth option: don't copy any of the poets consciously, just write about an object. Then add a paragraph of commentary afterwards on how you feel your poetics relates to the past week's poets—are you doing something completely different? Are there any similarities?
</ul>
<p class = "descript">
  Post by Sunday at 22:00. On Monday, we will look at some of the responses and try to figure out which aspect of the poet's style you are working with, and how your piece distinguishes itself from its original source of inspiration.
</p>

### Week 3: Sept 14, 16, 18 – Line

9/14: Robert Hass: Introduction, Chapters 1-3, from *A Little Book on Form*
<ul class="descript">
<li>Prior to class, put in the "line" slack channel a favorite quote from Hass or favorite quoted poem from the reading. Briefly comment on why you chose it, or not (in which case I will probably call on you in class to comment further).
<li>Keep a list of favorite lines mentioned in these chapters, in previous or future readings, and in poems you may have independently found. Try to figure out why you like a given line, couplet, or tercet of poetry. How does it &ldquo;embody the energy of the gesture of its making&rdquo;?  Put your thoughts in the "line" slack channel by Wednesday.
</ul>

9/16: Whitman, "Song of Myself"; Hass: "A Note on Stress," "How to Scan a Poem"

<p class="descript">
Keep a list of favorite lines from Whitman, adding to the "line" slack channel one excerpt that you are particularly drawn to, with or without commentary. You might want to scan it and discuss what you find. Add to slack by Friday.
</p>

9/18: Whitman cont., A.R. Ammons: Corsons Inlet; Hass: "How Free Verse Works"

<p class="descript">
Just read: Ammons, Hass, and any material cited by Hass that interests you. Start drafting your discussion board post, which is essentially a draft or proposal for Essay 1, "Line."
</p>

{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}
<p class="descript">
Share the poem you will be writing about for Essay 1. First write about what you notice (this does not have to be about the lineation of the poem). Then share a quote from the Hass reading you'd like to reference in the essay. You do not have to make an argument about how that quote on lineation relates to what you noticed (that's for you to elaborate in the essay). Post by Sunday at 22:00; read what your classmates have written over the course of the following week. </p>
{{< /details >}}

<span class="yellow">Essay 1 "Line" (Due 9/23, 22:00)</span>
<p class="descript", style="margin-top:-.5em">Revisions, if needed, are due on September 28.</p>

### Week 4: Sept 21, 23, 25 – Sonnet

<p class="descript">
We will take an &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; approach by reading a wide range of sonnets today by Rilke, Berrigan, Toomer, Hayes, Hopkins, Sor Juana, Pessoa, etc. A small "reader" will be linked here soon. This week we will ask, what do sonnets do? What makes this form so robust and versatile?
</p>

9/21: Selected sonnets, *Post-Petrarchism,* Chapter 1
<p class="descript">
Before class, read the chapter from <i>Post-Petrarchism.</i> In slack, share some lines that were interesting to you, and ask a question about something that was confusing or unclear. This reading is quite dense, so start early.
</p>

9/23: Selected sonnets (cont.)
<p class="descript">
Let's work on identifying deixis in sonnets. What kinds of deictics are present, and which ones stick out most to you? Are you observing important "internal" deictics? You may want to review Monday's slides in preparation for this class, but focus on finishing up Essay 1.
</p>


9/25: Shakespeare, Sonnets 1-30
<p class="descript">
How are the sonnets sequenced? What "kinds" of sonnets do you find? Prior to class, share in slack which sonnet stood out to you the most, and highlight a few lines in it that seemed particularly good. Again, commentary is optional.
</p>


### Week 5: Sept 28, 30, Oct 2 – Ode
<span class="blue" style="margin-left:0em">**Individual Conference II**</span>

9/28: *Theory of the Lyric*, Chapter 1
<p class="descript">
You will be assigned to briefly present on one of the nine poems presented in the chapter and Culler&rsquo;s interpretation of that poem. Also bring in another poem discussed in previous weeks; we will spend some time in class writing about how it involves the <q>four parameters.</q>
</p>

9/30: Marianne Moore, "An Octopus"

<p class="descript">
We will try to apply Culler&rsquo;s four parameters to this poem. Please share an annotated copy of some excerpt of the poem on slack (as image file, screenshot).
</p>

10/2: T.S. Eliot, "The Three Voices of Poetry"
<p class="descript">
Identify an instance of the "third voice" in any of the past or next week's readings. Make a brief argument for why that moment constitutes the "third" voice and not the first or second.
</p>


{{< details "Discussion Board" close >}}
<p class="descript">
Start Essay 2. Post two paragraphs. These can be from the body of the essay or the beginning. Due Sunday, 22:00.
</p>

### Week 14: Nov 30, Dec 2, 4 — Presentations

{{< details Guidelines open>}}
 Presentations are opportunities for you to share what you have been working on and stay accountable during the final stretch of writing for this course. Here are some constraints:
 * Each presentation block is 16-25 min. You may designate as little as 5 minutes or as much as 20 minutes to presenting. Remaining time will be dedicated to discussion.
 * Assign up to 2 pages of prose + 14 lines of poetry for the class to read prior to your presentation. If you want to share more, designate excerpts for your classmates to focus on. Submit the materials to me at least two days in advance so I can distribute them. Earlier is better.
 * During your presentation, recite the poems you are dealing with; if you are writing about multiple poems or long poems, you may delegate (have someone in the class read them out) and/or present shorter excerpts.

Here are some suggestions for what to present:

 * **Poem-centric:** Share a poem and prompt the class to share their reactions to it; provide some questions or an exercise to guide the discussion. No need to share your essay ideas, but having clear ideas about the poem is crucial to producing a well-moderated discussion. Pretend you're interviewing the class, or collecting data which may supplement your own writing.
 * **Essay-centric:** Share a paragraph or more of your essay draft; contextualize it, talk about your writing process, ask for feedback, make live modifications.
 * **Idea-centric:** Show us the argumentative arc of your essay. Point out areas where you are struggling to connect broader ideas to specific examples you'd like to include.
 *  **Class-centric:** Discuss how your essay and its ideas arise from specific units in the class, talk about how your essay is in dialogue with past class sessions. Best to do this if you're close to done with your essay and if you're one of the last presenters.

These are simply suggestions. Your presentation may be a blend of these options or something else entirely.
