# Essay 0 - "First Day"

Due: Monday, September 7th, 22:00  

### Prompt
We spent the first class reading from five poems. Pick one, re-read it and write about what you notice first (15 minutes). Then familiarize yourself with its source or supplementary materials (as noted on the slides). Take a break and do something entirely unrelated. Re-read the poem, and write about anything new you observe (30 minutes).

Example, from Chapter I of *Eunoia*:
> Writing is inhibiting. Sighing, I sit, scribbling in ink  
this pidgin script. I sing with nihilistic witticism,  
disciplining signs with trifling gimmicks – impish  
hijinks which highlight stick sigils. Isn’t it glib?  
Isn’t it chic? I fit childish insights within rigid limits,  
writing shtick which might instill priggish misgiv-  
ings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nit-   
picking criticism which flirts with philistinism. I  
bitch; I kibitz – griping whilst criticizing dimwits,    
sniping whilst indicting nitwits, dismissing simplis-  
tic thinking, in which philippic wit is still illicit.

<ul style="font-family:'Times'; margin-left:4em;">
   <li> On first reading, I observed that every word uses only the vowel &lsquo;i&rsquo;....<br>
   <li> On second reading, I realized that the first-person perspective of the passage is correlated with the univocalic constraint....</ul>
<ul style="font-family:'Times'; margin-left:4em;">
   <li> On first reading, I felt a sense of irritation....<br>
   <li> On second reading, I felt a humor in the text....</ul>

### Further instructions

* Feel free to complete one of the above trains of thought.
* You may use a pattern-focused approach (what linguistic patterns do I notice?), affective approach (what mood or sensation do I feel?), rhetorical approach (what do I believe the purpose of this text to be?), or hermeneutic approach (what do I think this text means?) to refine the scope of your thinking.
* The essay should be two paragraphs, maybe three.
* You should describe your engagement with the supplementary materials in the second paragraph.
* If there is a link between the first and second paragraphs, feel free to reflect on that in the third.
* Use the listed time constraints for drafting the essay, but spend some time beyond the initial 45 minutes editing what you have written.
* You may find the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www-oed-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu) helpful, especially if you notice a word that is new to you or want to refer to its etymology for the second reading.
* 1-2 pages, 1.5 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style
* Grade: (Timely) Completion. This is a low-stakes assignment.
* Submit: On Canvas as PDF.

### Looking Ahead
Deploying this kind of exercise regularly will help you become more attentive to your own reading practices, sensibilities, and habits. Time-constrained observational writing is an excellent tool for beginning the more complex assignments we will encounter later in this course.
