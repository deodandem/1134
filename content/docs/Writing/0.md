# Essay 0 - "First Day"

Due Saturday, 8/28 at 22:00  
Peer review due Monday, 8/30 at 22:00

### Prompt
We spent the first class discussing what we mean by the word "poetic" and reading from several different poems. Your task is now to choose one of these poems and discuss how it corresponds to or wavers from your notion of the "poetic." In order to accomplish this, please follow these steps:

1. Spend 15-30 minutes reflecting on what the word "poetic" means to you. It is best to invoke a specific example; try to tell a story of how you've encountered this term, rather than an impersonal or generalized definition of the word "poetic." If you don't have personal experiences or memories to refer to, you may do some basic research on the word and cite an external resource, but this is a last resort. When you're satisfied with what you've written, take a break.

2. Pick a poem to examine. Preferrably your favorite poem, or your least favorite. Take some time to write about what you notice within it (15-30 minutes). Cite specific textual evidence. You may also cite your affective reactions to the text (e.g., How does it make you feel? What does it remind you of?). You don't have to think too hard about whether these attributes of the poem are "poetic" or not. The point of this paragraph is to present to your reader what you see as the most important characteristics of a poem which they may not have read carefully themself. Take a break.

3. Reread what you wrote in the first paragraph. Write a third paragraph which connects what you noticed" in the poem with what you believe to be poetic. Make it clear to yourself and the reader—does this poem match with what I consider to be poetic? If so, how? If not, where does it 'fail'? And finally, has your notion of the poetic changed after writing this essay?

### Further instructions

* You may pick a poem not discussed in class.
* You may want to do some light research on the author and familiarize yourself with other poems they've written, but this is not required.
* There are many things you could 'notice' or comment on when faced with a poem—you may use a pattern-focused approach (what linguistic patterns do I notice?), affective approach (what mood or sensation do I feel?), rhetorical approach (what do I believe the purpose of this text to be?), or hermeneutic approach (what do I think this text means?) to refine the scope of your reading.
* The essay should be three paragraphs, approximately.
* 1-2 pages, 1.7 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style.
   * Be sure to do the citations and formatting properly, to demonstrate that you are familiar with the the MLA rules. Refer to the MLA guidelines [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) and check out the MLA Template under > Files > Templates on Canvas.

### Learning Objectives
* One of our main preocupations in this class is on what we *value* in poetry, and how to better understand those values through the writing process. This essay should provides you with a good sense of what you value now, and with some of the difficulties that come with trying to share these values with others.
* This is also a chance to practice observational writing. Taking stock of what you notice in a poem or any other object regularly will help you become more attentive to your own reading practices, sensibilities, and habits.
* In academic writing, it's essential to point out specific details in an object of study, and to tell vivid stories that motivate a piece of research as you present it.
