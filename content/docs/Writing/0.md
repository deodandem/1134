# Essay 0 - "First Day"

Due Friday, 8/26 at 22:00  
Peer Review due 8/28 at 22:00

### Prompt
We spent the first class discussing the meaning of "poetry" and reading several different poems. Your task is to put forth your own notion of "poetry" and discuss how a specific poem corresponds to or wavers from what you've set forth. In order to accomplish this, please follow these steps:

1. Spend 30 minutes reflecting on what the word "poetry" means to you. It is best to invoke a specific example; try to tell a story of how you've encountered this term, rather than an impersonal or generalized definition. If you don't have personal experiences or memories to refer to, you may cite one of the essays we discussed in class, but this is a last resort. When you're satisfied with what you've written, take a break. (1-2 paragraphs)

2. Pick a poem to examine—preferrably your favorite poem, or your least favorite. Take some time to write about why you chose it and what it is "about"; assume your reader does not know the poem (15 minutes). Then spend some time discussing it in detail (15 minutes). You may discuss your affective response to specific words or lines: what effects do they have on your body? How are your responses linked to the formal structures in the poem (i.e., repetition, rhyme, meter)? How is your response to those features conditioned by knowledge you have of the world outside the poem? Be sure to cite specific lines from the poem in your analysis. The point of this section is to present to your reader what you see as the most important characteristics of the poem. (2-3 paragraphs)

3. Reread what you wrote. Make sure that there is some motivation for the shift between your first and second sections. See if you want to make any modifications or additions to anything you've written. Then, write a final paragraph which connects what you noticed" in the poem with your initial discussion. Make it clear to yourself and the reader—does this poem match with what I consider to be poetic? If so, how? If not, where does it fail? And has your notion of poetry changed after writing this essay?

### Learning Objectives
* One of our main preocupations in this class is on what we *value* in poetry, and how to better understand those values through the writing process. This essay should provides you with a good sense of what you value now, and with some of the difficulties that come with trying to share these values with others.
* This is also a chance to practice observational writing. Taking stock of what you notice in a poem or any other object regularly will help you become more attentive to your own reading practices, sensibilities, and habits.
* In academic writing, it's essential to point out specific details in an object of study, and to tell vivid stories that motivate a piece of research as you present it.
