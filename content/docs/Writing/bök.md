# Essay 0 - "First Day"

Due: Monday, September 7th, 22:00  

### Prompt
We spent the first class reading from Christian Bök's *Eunoia.*

> “Writing is inhibiting. Sighing, I sit, scribbling in ink  
this pidgin script. I sing with nihilistic witticism,   disciplining signs with trifling gimmicks – impish  
hijinks which highlight stick sigils. Isn’t it glib?  
Isn’t it chic? I fit childish insights within rigid limits,   writing shtick which might instill priggish misgiv-  
ings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nit-  
picking criticism which flirts with philistinism. I  
bitch; I kibitz – griping whilst criticizing dimwits,  
sniping whilst indicting nitwits, dismissing simplis-  
tic thinking, in which philippic wit is still illicit.”

Each chapter uses only one of the five vowels in the English alphabet. While this restricts the set of words the poet may use, he still has considerable freedom of choice. So why does each chapter proceed in the way that it does? Choose one of the chapters ("A," "E," "I," "O," "U") and pick a single word in it. Write about the role it plays.


### Further instructions

* You may describe the general Does the chapter tell a story? Does it have markers of plot, character, and narration? Does the word help tell a story, produce a certain mood or affect, or insert a concrete image that would otherwise not be there?
* Does the word seem obviously bound to the rules of the text, or does it seem liberated from these rules?
* How does the word relate to what immediately surrounds it? Does the word produce some kind of movement or stasis?
* You may find the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www-oed-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu) helpful, especially if you write about a word that is new to you or want to refer to its etymology
* Length: 2 pages, 1.5 spacing, Times New Roman  
* Grade: Completion. This is a low-stakes assignment.
* Submit: On Canvas as PDF; Include recitation as audio file

### Looking Ahead
We are going to be focusing on poems for much of this course, with the assumption that poems are a specifically linguistic form of poetry. This assignment gives you an opportunity to think about what poetry means for you outside of the linguistic sphere, and even outside of traditionally conceived “aesthetic experience.” Reflecting on what the poetic means to you will help guide you in future decisions in this course and beyond, in terms of what you choose to write about or study. This essay also invokes the same skills necessary for close engagement with poems in a scholarly/analytical context—close attention to detail, and the intent to clearly define and apply certain terms, often in conversation with another writer’s discussion of the same or related terminologies. It therefore provides an initial record of your aptitude for essay-writing.
