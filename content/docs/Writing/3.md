# Essay 3 - "Punctum"

### Prompt
In Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes seeks to describe how photographs generate desire in him as a viewer, and comes up with two key terms, studium and punctum. Read his definition below:

> What I feel about these photographs derives from an average affect, almost from a certain training. I did not know a French word which might account for this kind of human interest, but I believe this word exists in Latin: it is studium, which doesn’t mean, at least not immediately, “study,” but application to a thing, taste for someone, a kind of general, enthusiastic commitment, of course, but without special acuity. It is by studium that I am interested in so many photographs, whether I receive them as political testimony or enjoy them as good historical scenes: for it is culturally (this connotation is present in studium) that I participate in the figures, the faces, the gestures, the settings, the actions.

> The second element will break (or punctuate) the studium. This time it is not I who seek it out (as I invest the field of the studium with my sovereign consciousness), it is this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me. A Latin word exists to designate this wound, this prick, this mark made by a pointed instrument: the word suits me all the better in that it also refers to the notion of punctuation, and because the photographs I am speaking of are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds are so many points. This second element which will disturb the studium I shall therefore call punctum; for punctum is also: sting, speck, cut, little hole—and also a cast of the dice. A photograph’s punctum is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me). (25-27)

### Task

Find a punctum in a poem of your choosing. This punctum should be a word to a line in length. If the word appears multiple times, choose only one of its appearances. You will need to contextualize the punctum by describing its relation to the sentence or line in which it occurs. The punctum might be your favorite point in the poem, or it might be the most troubling or confusing moment. Once you have chosen this punctum, begin your essay by describing what it is about this punctum that “pricks” you. Your description may lead you to discuss other points of interest in the poem, but make sure to circle back to the punctum at the end of your essay.


### Further instructions

* As Barthes wrote, it is going to be an unnamable disturbance—but that doesn’t mean it can’t be described! It simply means that you will likely need to show how the punctum diverges from the poem’s studium, or what might be called its “normative” language. Use your note-taking on ritual and fictional elements as a guide for identifying such norms.
* Don’t worry too much about the Barthes quote on the “intentionality” of the punctum. Photographers have less control over what appears in their pictures than poets have control over the words they use. However, it is good to think about whether a certain moment in a poem feels like it has been constructed in an intentional manner or not: this may signal that a point of interest is exactly that—a point of interest, but not something truly “piercing.”
* Keep in mind that it may take multiple readings and some time away from the poem in order to figure out what the punctum is. Reading the poem out loud is a necessity; it helps you slow down and notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. You should definitely start reading early and often; this way when you sit down to write, you will have more thoughts to work with.
* A punctum will “overwhelm,” leading to an “intense mutation of my interest, a fulguration.”
* If you want to read more on the studium and punctum, refer to the sections running from 10-24 in Camera Lucida; the PDF of the book is posted on Canvas under Week 2.


### Looking Ahead
Identifying a punctum can be a strong way of starting an essay. It is also likely that you will be led from your punctum to learn or notice some aspect of the poem you didn’t recognize before. In this way identifying the punctum serves as a research method which will aid you in developing your final essay for the semester.
