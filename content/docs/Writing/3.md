# Essay 3 - "Punctum"

(Due Friday, 10/30, 22:00)

### Prompt
In Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes seeks to describe how photographs generate desire in him as a viewer, and comes up with two key terms, *studium* and *punctum*. Read his definition below:

> What I feel about these photographs derives from an average affect, almost from a certain training. I did not know a French word which might account for this kind of human interest, but I believe this word exists in Latin: it is *studium,* which doesn’t mean, at least not immediately, “study,” but application to a thing, taste for someone, a kind of general, enthusiastic commitment, of course, but without special acuity. It is by *studium* that I am interested in so many photographs, whether I receive them as political testimony or enjoy them as good historical scenes: for it is culturally (this connotation is present in *studium*) that I participate in the figures, the faces, the gestures, the settings, the actions.

> The second element will break (or punctuate) the *studium*. This time it is not I who seek it out (as I invest the field of the *studium* with my sovereign consciousness), it is this element which rises from the scene, shoots out of it like an arrow, and pierces me. A Latin word exists to designate this wound, this prick, this mark made by a pointed instrument: the word suits me all the better in that it also refers to the notion of punctuation, and because the photographs I am speaking of are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds are so many points. This second element which will disturb the *studium* I shall therefore call *punctum*; for *punctum* is also: sting, speck, cut, little hole—and also a cast of the dice. A photograph’s *punctum* is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me). (25-27)

[Refer to sections 10-24 in *Camera Lucida* for more.]

Find a *punctum* in a poem of your choosing. It could be word, phrase, line, or sentence at a specific location in the poem. Then write about it. What is it about this punctum that “pricks” you? How does it stand out against the poem's *studium*? The *punctum* might be your favorite point in the poem, or it might be the most troubling or confusing. Your description may lead you to discuss other parts of the poem, but make sure to circle back to the *punctum* at the end of your essay.


### Further notes
* A punctum will “overwhelm,” leading to an “intense mutation of [your] interest, a fulguration.”
* In order to describe the *punctum* you will need to discuss how it diverges from or is separate from the poem’s *studium*, or what might be called its “normative” language. Use your notes on the ritual and fictional elements of the poem as a guide for identifying such norms. Or, treat the poem like a photograph that comes from a place and time—do historical or biographical research on the poet, or on the images and allusions involved in the poem (scientific conceits, for instance).
* Keep in mind that it may take multiple readings and some time away from the poem in order to figure out what your *punctum* is. Reading the poem out loud is a necessity; it helps you slow down and notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. Transcribing by hand or keyboard is similarly helpful.
* The analogy between photography and poetry is imperfect. Don't take everything Barthes says as some kind of universal truth. For instance, you may not worry too much about the "unintentionality" of the *punctum*, since poets often exercise more agency over what appears in their poems than photographers do over what appears in their photographs. The *punctum* of a poem may seem quite obviously willed by the poet, but remain striking and beautiful.


### Specifications


<ol style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Include a rich description of the poem's studium and its punctum.
<li> Provide a brief summary of Barthes' terms so that the reader knows how you construe these ideas; provide relevant citations. Again, you may modify the definitions provided by Barthes to better suit your own purposes, just be explicit about this.
<li> Exercise care in your choice of words, syntax, and sentence sequencing.
<li> Make sure the paper is relatively free of typographical and spelling errors.
<li> Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the "Appendix" of your paper, prior to the Works Cited page.
<li> Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing. The body of the paper should be around 4 pages. Submit to Canvas as a PDF.

</ol>

### Grading criteria

You will be doing peer review on this paper, and I will provide an evaluative comment.
Otherwise, this paper is for a completion grade, meaning that you must satisfy items 1-2 and 5-6. While there is no "revision window" for this essay, you may want to use this as a prototype for Essay 4, and should incorporate feedback prior to turning in the Essay 4 draft.

### Looking Ahead
Identifying a punctum can be a strong way of starting an essay and developing a focal question. Writing about the studium is a way of incorporating external research into this paper. The personal nature of the studium may also allow you to incorporate modes of writing that are more narrative or journalistic in nature. This essay will hopefully allow you to reflect on which theoretical methods you prefer to use, what poems you enjoy writing about, what challenges you are facing when doing external research, and how you relate to your subject matter.
