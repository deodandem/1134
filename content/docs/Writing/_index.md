# Essay Horizon

<p style="margin-left:0; margin-top:2em;">
The essay sequence is designed to lead you to a final paper. Each of the assignments emphasizes a different skill, mode of argumentation, or type of writing. Here's a brief synopsis of what you should be learning by completing each essay:

Essay 0: Centers observation, under few constraints. Reveals what you are accustomed to seeing in poems. The most successful essays are detailed but concise, and follow the two-step structure of the essay with fidelity. This is a bit like a journal entry, or a field report.

Essay 1: Centers observation under a specific formal vocabulary (rhyme, line, meter). Tests your ability to produce a succinct description of the essay's overarching method and trajectory, and to fluidly link a heterogenous set of observations under that program. The "program" in all likelihood takes the form of the basic question: *how do line groupings and meter contribute to the meaning of the poem?* 

Essay 2: Centers dialogue. Your main task is to respond to someone else's take on a poem, poet, or poetry. Being able to succinctly summarize and contextualize

Essay 3: This essay may resemble journalistic writing or creative non-fiction. You will work on describing the world of a poem and what draws you to it. You may revisit the more technical mode of analysis from Essay 1 or the more argumentative and dialectical mode of Essay 2 in forming the argument of this piece.

Essay 4: You may choose to expand what you wrote for Essay 0, Essay 1, Essay 2, and Essay 3 or to refactor the prompts in order to design the fourth. The essay should have an intriguing and well-designed argumentative structure, and be fairly well-written on the sentence level. Since you will be given more time and space to write this essay, you will also incorporate some amount of research, which could help you tie this project closer to interests that were not explicitly a part of this class.
