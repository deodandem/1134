# Essay 1 - "Line"

Due Wednesday, 9/23, 22:00  
Revisions due on 9/30, 22:00

### Prompt
Consider the following passage from Robert Hass's *A Little Book on Form*:

> The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox.‚Äù

Choose a poem and think about how its lineation relates to its meaning. Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that repeat or which stand out to you? How is enjambment used in the poem? How long are the lines, metrically or visually speaking, and how does line-length relate to syntax?

Here's a suggested list of poems to write about:
<ul style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself" (either the 1855 or 1891-92 version)
<li> Any poem by A.R. Ammons, especially "Corsons Inlet"
<li> Any poem in H.D.'s <i>Sea Garden</i>
<li> Any poem in Reginald Shepherd's <i>Otherhood</i>
<li> Any of the sonnets for Week 3
<li> Gertrude Stein's "Susie Asado"
</ul>

Then, choose some specific sections of the poem and write about how they help you understand the significance of the numbers 1, 2, or 3 in the poem's formation.

### Further instructions

1. Follow the prompt, respond to the prompt.
2. Cite a passage from Hass's book to frame your argument.
3. Help the reader understand why the numbers 1, 2, or 3 are important in reading the poem.
4. The introduction should include a question or conjecture.
5. The final paragraph should reconstruct your argument (i.e., summarize it concisely) and reflect on possible routes for further inquiry.
6. Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, free of grammatical errors.
7. Sentences should flow well: length and syntax should be varied in a way that helps the reader grasp each statement's meaning and stay engaged throughout the reading process.
8. Sentences should be sequenced in a way that makes sense; otherwise give a disclaimer that the essay is entering digressive or speculative territory, and then return to the previous point.
9. Remind the reader of precisely what you are talking about by quoting directly from the poem or secondary material.
10. Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially with verbs and prepositions.
11. Use the proper tense (largely present) and person (first and third; avoid the pronoun "it" unless the antecedent is clear).
12. Include proper in-text citations (including citations of line numbers).
13. Use template on Canvas to transcribe the poem or excerpt and include as first page of your paper. This page doesn't count as part of the length specifications below.
14. The paper should be 3-4 pages, with 1.7 spacing, MLA style, and a Works Cited page, which should include Hass's book and the poem you've written about.
15. Submit a recitation of poem or relevant excerpt as audio file to Canvas.

### Grading criteria

A: 15/15  
A-: 13-14/15  
B+: 10-12/15  
B: 6-9/15  
B-: Satisfies instructions 1-5

If you revise your essay successfully, the new grade replaces the old one. The deadline for revision may be modified depending on how fast the instructor is able to return feedback.


### Looking Ahead
This exercise will help you identify an important formal element of poetry, and will also require you to provide a description of a poem's meaning. The process of connecting structural patterns to your impressions of a poem's overall insights will prepare you for future essays in this course.
