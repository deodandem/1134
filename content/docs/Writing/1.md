# Essay 1 - "Line"

(Due 9/21, 22:00)

### Prompt
Consider the following passage from Robert Hass's *A Little Book on Form*:

> The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox.‚Äù


### Task
Choose a poem and discuss how its lineation relates to its meaning.

### Further instructions

Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that repeat or which stand out to you? Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? How is enjambment used in the poem? Begin by taking many notes. Then step back and read the poem without attempting to analyze it. This time, try to get at is overall meaning, emotional tenor, how it sounds, what it depicts. Iterate over these two steps until you feel ready to write about how your two kinds of reading experience are connected.

### Looking Ahead
This exercise will help you identify an important formal element of poetry, and will also require you to provide a description of a poem's meaning. The process of connecting structural patterns to your impressions of a poem's overall insights will prepare you for future essays in this course.
