# Essay 1 - "Line"

Due Wednesday, 9/25, 22:00  
Revisions due on 10/7, 22:00

### Prompt
Consider the following passage from Robert Hass's *A Little Book on Form*:

> The sentence imitates insight. It is the mode of individuation, the thought that separates us from others and gives us a self. To say it another way, the sentence is being, enjambment is excess of being, or being in process, reaching toward itself. Which is its basic characteristic. Excess and instability and movement and change. The sentence moves and it arrests movement.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The sentence is also an action, an event in time. In one way of thinking, being is stasis; in another it is movement, that is, the only being we have is becoming, and the self is movement (we are not things but processes). However, the sentence is the instrument through which the self-as-a-process mimics being-as-a-process, at the same time that it arrests it. A sentence, unlike actions in the world, is a proposition of finitude; it has a beginning and an end. The tension in the sentence between its action and its stillness is a source of endless paradox. (11)

Choose a poem and think about how its lineation relates to its meaning. Is it divided into stanzas or implicit sections of a set length? How is enjambment used in the poem? How long are the lines, and what are their syntactic components? Can you find groups of one, two, three, or four lines that stand out to you? Do these groupings form archetypal patterns like call-and-response or syllogism? Write about how a feature of the poem's lineation relates to its meaning.

Choose a poem and read it out loud. Determine which excerpts of the poem appeal to you most, and scan them. See if you notice any patterns in the meter which relate to the meaning or other aspects of your favorite lines (which may include syntax, for instance). Here's a corresponding inspirational quote from Hass—

> The work of prosody in free verse, as in metrical verse, comes once the poem is under way. The twos and threes, or the fours and threes and then fours; the choice of making stanzas or not making stanzas, what kind of line endings—that work. You are hearing a poem that is grave and slow, or charged and relentless, or hesitant, or easy and fluid, the sense of sound, arc of development, play with undevelopment, image- or thought-cascade occurring and telling you what it wants to be, form and content beginning to be a body. The final form exactly right, or not—seeming just okay, adequate to the task, but not radiant, not the radiance. (428)

Here's a suggested list of poems to write about:
<ul style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself" (either the 1855 or 1891-92 version)
<li> Robert Hass's "Meditation at Lagunitas"
<li> A Robert Frost poem mentioned in *A Little Book on Form*
<li> Any poem by A.R. Ammons, especially "Corsons Inlet"
<li> Any poem in H.D.'s <i>Sea Garden</i>
<li> Any poem in Reginald Shepherd's <i>Otherhood</i>
<li> Any of the sonnets in the Sonnet Reader
<li> Gertrude Stein's "Susie Asado"
</ul>

### Further instructions

<ol style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Cite a passage from Hass's book to frame your argument.
<li> Follow the prompt, respond to the prompt.
<li> Help the reader understand why line-groupings of size 1, 2, or 3 are important in reading the poem. If you're doing the meter prompt, help your reader understand the importance of a specific metrical pattern (a type of foot, a sequencing of certain feet, etc.).
<li> The introduction should include a question or conjecture.
<li> The final paragraph should reconstruct your argument (i.e., summarize it concisely) and reflect on possible routes for further inquiry.
<li> Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, free of grammatical errors.
<li> Sentences should flow well: length and syntax should be varied in a way that helps the reader grasp each statement's meaning and stay engaged throughout the reading process.
<li> Sentences should be sequenced in a way that makes sense; otherwise give a disclaimer that the essay is entering digressive or speculative territory, and then return to the previous point.
<li> Remind the reader of precisely what you are talking about by quoting directly from the poem or secondary material. If you're writing about meter, denote meter-markings below a quoted line from a poem using x (unstressed) and – (stressed) to denote the syllables. Separate feet, if applicable, using｜or || for a caesura.
<li> Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially prepositions and verbs.
<li> Use the proper tense (mostly present) and person (first and third; avoid the pronoun "it" unless the antecedent is clear).
<li> Include proper in-text citations (including citations of line numbers).
<li> Use template on Canvas to transcribe the poem or excerpt and include as first page of your paper. This page doesn't count as part of the length specifications below.
<li> The paper should be 3-4 pages, with 1.7 spacing, MLA style, and a Works Cited page, which should include Hass's book and the poem you've written about, plus any encyclopedia or dictionary entries you may have consulted.
<li> Submit a recitation of poem or relevant excerpt as audio file to Canvas.
</ol>

### Grading criteria

A: 15/15  
A-: 13-14/15  
B+: 10-12/15  
B: 6-9/15  
B-: Satisfies instructions 1-5

If you revise your essay successfully, the new grade replaces the old one. The deadline for revision may be modified depending on how fast the instructor is able to return feedback. If you have even the smallest question don't hesitate to ask.


### Looking Ahead
This exercise will help you identify an important formal element of poetry, and will also require you to provide a description of a poem's meaning. The process of connecting structural patterns to your impressions of a poem's overall insights will prepare you for future essays in this course.
