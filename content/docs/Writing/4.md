# Essay 4 - "Trade"

### Prompt

I will now assign you to read a poem somebody else in the class has written on for Assignment 3.

Using the guidelines from Assignments 2 and 3, take notes on the studium of this new poem and identify one punctum. Then write an essay like the one you produced for Assignment 3, also 1000-2000 words. Your essay will then be sent over to the person who first wrote about it, and you will receive a second perspective on what you wrote for Assignment 3.

### Looking Ahead

When scholars do research, they are part of a living community of researchers. Often this means that they are able to email, talk, interview one another and get feedback on their ideas in progress. For this reason, I’ve asked you to exchange ideas with one another in the same format, rather than have you look online for secondary sources. Of course, you can incorporate external research into your final essay, but first focus on responding to the fresh perspectives at hand.

For the next and final assignment, you will incorporate the ideas you received from your classmate into what you have written for Assignment 3. This will help you organize your thoughts, as you may choose to limit the scope of your analysis to something relevant to what both you and your classmate wrote about. You may also choose to distinguish your own analysis from that of your classmate, prefacing your essay with a description of “what others have written” about the poem, and how you will now contribute something new to the discourse. Finally, you may even change or refine your views of the punctum and studium of the poem based on your peers’ insights.
