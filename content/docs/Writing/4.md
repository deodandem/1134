# Essay 4 - "Prompt"

Draft due 11/16 at 22:00  
Final due 12/17 at 22:00

### Prompt

Design your own prompt and run it by me. A more definitive list of suggested prompts will be determined by Week 8. We will brainstorm in class together. Make use of office hours if needed.

### Suggestions

* Write a comparative essay using your own punctum and another classmateâ€™s punctum for the same poem. Feel free to collaborate more with your classmate by asking them further questions.
* Write a comparative essay on two different poems of your choosing; they may be poems by the same author, from the same collection, or by different authors working in a related form or genre.
* Translate a poem into English and write about your choices and any research you did in order to make these choices.
* Track 3: Write on one poem, but from two different perspectives (two puncta, or using two distinct methods).
* Write a comparative essay discussing the relationship between a poem and a non-poem.
* Let's say you want to publish a small, online anthology of poems. To begin, choose three poems and make an argument for how they fit into your anthology.

### Specifications

* 8-12 pages, 1.7 spacing, 12pt, Times New Roman, MLA style
* Type up poem or relevant excerpt on first page, use template on Canvas for easy line numbering.
* Grade: 40%. Rubric will be released a week in advance.
* Submit: On Canvas as PDF; Include recitation as audio file


### Looking Ahead

Being able to design your own prompt is an essential skill for future research, especially in the humanities, where it is rare to be given a specific, well-designed research question by your professor. If you do work in the sciences, figuring out your own course of action given a problem can be a driver for innovation within a more regimented set of expectations and conventions.
