Design your own prompt and run it by me. A more definitive list of suggested prompts will be determined by week 8.

### Suggestions

* Write a comparative essay using your own punctum and another classmateâ€™s punctum for the same poem. Feel free to collaborate more with your classmate by asking them further questions.

* Translate a poem into English and write about your choices and any research you did in order to make these choices.
* Track 3: Write on one poem, but from two different perspectives (two puncta, or using two distinct methods).
