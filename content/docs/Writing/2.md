# Essay 2 - "Ritual and Fiction"

Due Wednesday, 10/14 at 22:00,  
Revisions due on 10/21 at 22:00

### Prompt
As we have discussed in class, lyric poetry may be defined in terms of its “ritual” and “fictional” elements. Choose a poem and identify specific words and lines where the “ritual” element is particularly salient, i.e. where repeated patterns occur. Then consider how the poem might be narrated as in a novel or film. Who is speaking? What is being described? What are the relationships between the speaker(s) and object(s) in the “scene” of the poem?

### Task
Once you have taken notes on the “ritual” and “fictional” elements separately, take a break. Come back and re-read the poem out loud, preferably at a point where you have forgotten the details of your notes. Then, ask yourself whether the ritual or fictional elements stuck out to you more. Do the two have a strong relationship with one another? Write about what you discover.

### Looking Ahead

Describing the “normative” features or “natural tendencies” of a poem is essential to recognizing the points at which the poem diverges from the norm it sets up. In the next assignment, we will be focusing more on identifying a key point, or punctum, of the poem as a starting point for analysis.

Note that we are not looking to do too much external research at this point, but I will respond to your essays with some ideas on what you might look into if you were to do research on the poem.
