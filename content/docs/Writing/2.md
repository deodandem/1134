# Essay 2 - "Speaker"

Due Saturday, 4/3 at 22:00; revisions due 4/16 at 22:00

### Prompt
As we have discussed in class, lyric poetry may be defined in terms of it use of “ritual” and “fictional” elements, in terms of the "four parameters," or in terms of the "three voices." These terms ultimately help us discuss the simple question: "Who is speaking, and in response to what?" Respond to this through any of the following sub-prompts:


<ul style="margin-left: 2em">
<li> Discuss how a sonnet or ghazal responds to the tradition in which it is embedded. Does it recapitulate a common theme, and if so, does it contribute something new? Be sure to cite two poems: one which represents the tradition, and another which forms the center of your analysis. You may cite and mention additional poems as reference points.
<li> Write about a poem that seems particularly "lyrical" to you and one which seems less so; discuss why this is the case. This may help readers understand what makes some poems more poetic than others, or it may help them better appreciate the latter poem.
<li> Describe the "enunciative apparatus" of a poem. Who is involved? What are the relationships between writer, speaker, addressee, and reader? Can you localize instances of the "three voices" of poetry in this poem? Be sure to justify your interpretation by discussing multiple ways in which the enunciative apparatus could be framed.
    
</ul>

### Specifications
<ol style="margin-left:3em">

<li> Capture the reader's attention and produce a sense of intrigue in the opening paragraph. Make it clear that the poem you are writing about is interesting or important and explain why you feel a need to analyze it through a particular method.

* You might lead in with a personal anecdote or description of the poem's historical context. This can include quotation or discussion of what someone else wrote about the poem. Or, you might begin with an immersive, detailed description of the poem's imagery or language.
* Regardless of approach, it is essential to eventually lead the reader to your thesis statement. This might entail creating a narrowing of focus, from general context to a more specific focus on the poem(s), or a widening of focus, from detailed description to questions of broader concern.

<li> Demonstrate an explicit understanding of the term(s) you are working with and how you are using it. Are you using the term exactly as the original author intended it to be used, or are you modifying it slightly and taking it into a new context? Provide citations.
<li> Close the introduction (first or second paragraph) with a question and/or a brief synopsis of the rest of your essay. If you do not use a question-answer approach, frame the thesis as a contrasting claim.

* Q&A: *How does this poem create such a vivid fictional world? Let us consider how its use of personal, spatial, and temporal deixis might furnish a response.*
* C&A: *While it may seem evident that this poem employs more ritual than fictive elements, I argue/show/explore how its fictive elements are indeed central to the poem's expressive power.*

(A "thesis" is a falsifiable statement. It is not obviously true, it may be downright provocative. It exists as the product of some kind of dialogue. That is why it is imperative to introduce it with a leading question or a counterclaim. You can imagine someone in the room talking to you, asking the question, demanding clarification, encouraging you to expand on what has been written. This is the organizational principle of essay writing.)

<li> The last paragraph should recapitulate what you discovered or discussed in the essay and then return to the original thesis statement. Did the essay sufficiently resolve the "tension" in your thesis? In what ways were the theoretical terms helpful for reading, interpreting, or gaining a better appreciation for the poem(s) you are writing about? In what ways were they insufficient?

<li> Sequence the body paragraphs in an intentional fashion. You might want to begin with an observation that seems easiest and move to the most difficult. You may analyze random selection of excerpts, or work through a short poem in chronological order. Regardless of approach, make sure it is clear how each new paragraph adds to or complicates what you have developed in the previous paragraphs. "Moreover" signals the former and "however" the latter. "First/Second/Third" signals a clear separation in ideas, which is helpful, but it can likewise reveal a lack of logical connections.

<li> Provide vivid evidence of your claims by quoting directly and concisely from the text. Include block quotes where apt, i.e. to provide important context, or where you plan on engaging in prolonged commentary on the quote in question. Make decisions as to how detailed you want to be based on imagining your reader. Where might they need more assistance in seeing the detailed observations or thought processes behind your claims?

<li> Sentences should be sequenced in a way that is clearly motivated and which propels the reader's interest forward. Use first-person language to steer your argument: "I will now shift focus to..."; "Now that we have defined "fictive utterance," let us see how..." Make use of prepositional phrases, imperatives, and questions to punctuate your prose.

* *<b>By</b> investigating how Poet uses Device, we can...*
* *<b>Notice</b> how poet uses Device to orient the reader...*
* *<b>How</b> does the poet's use of Device relate to the meaning of...?*
<li> Pay attention to sentence rhythm. Interweave short and long, simple and complex; use contrasts to your advantage. Avoid unwarranted, consecutive repetition of words and phrases (e.g. "this..." or "indeed"). A quick proofreading trick is to simply highlight every sentence with the cursor as you comb through your essay.

<li> Pay attention to how you are using different parts of speech.

* Use active verbs in the simple present. Here's a <a href="https://english.edward.io">syntax highlighter</a>, use it! Check to see if you are overusing any verbal form of "be" or "have." In many cases, these can be replaced by something more apt.
* Use prepositions/postpositions judiciously. Too much of "of" or "as" can obscure the meaning of a sentence. If you find a sentence with too many prepositions, replace some with a verb.
* Use concrete and suggestive nouns and adjectives. They may refer very directly and literally to what you are writing about, or describe that thing by way of metaphor. Define any terms you are using in an idiosyncratic or special way. Be especially aware of this if you find yourself repeating a word that does not come directly from the poem.


<hr style="border: .5px solid rgb(147,141,123); margin: 2em auto; width: 40%">

<li> Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. This normally takes the form of <i>Noun-Phrase + Prepositional-Phrase</i>, e.g. "Ritual and Fiction in Rilke's New Poems." It can also be bipartite, separated by a colon into two lines: "You Must Change Your Life: The Use of Apostrophe in Rilke's New Poems"
<li> Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the "Appendix" of your paper and cite line numbers from the Appendix. Tip: Use template on Canvas, especially for "An Octopus." You can just cite page numbers from "Self-Portrait of a Convex Mirror," or any other long poem.
<li> If you incorporate secondary sources beyond what has been convered in class, make sure they are reputable, scholarly sources. Consult me for advice on where to find them or what sources to choose.
<li> Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. If typing up meter, do it in a consistent style, following the guidelines from Essay 1.
<li> The paper should be relatively free of typographical, spelling, and grammar errors. Check for verb agreement, extra/missing spaces and indents, and proper placement of punctuation near quotes.
<li> The body of the paper should be around 4 pages (this is a minimum).

### Looking Ahead

Like the previous essay, this prompt allows you to practice reading a poem using specific terms and methodologies inherited from another text. However, it is a bit more open-ended and should give you a better feel for what kind of methods you prefer to use in the final paper. This essay also opens the avenue for writing about groups or sequences of poems, and for incorporating a wider array of external resources.
