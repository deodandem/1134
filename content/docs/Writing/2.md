# Essay 2 - "Ritual and Fiction"

Due Wednesday, 10/16 at 22:00,  
Revisions due on 10/26 at 22:00

### Prompt
As we have discussed in class, lyric poems may be defined in terms of their “ritual” and “fictional” elements, in terms of the "four parameters," or in terms of the "three voices." Choose a poem (or several short ones) and demonstrate how it embodies any of these categories. You may choose to use only one of these theoretical approaches, or a blend of several. Here are some sub-prompts you may choose to address:


* Choose a poem and identify specific words and lines where the <span class="key">ritual</span> element is particularly salient. Then consider how the poem inhabits a <span class="key">fictional</span> space—How it might be narrated as in a novel or film? Who is speaking? What is being described? What are the relationships between the speaker(s) and object(s) in the “scene” of the poem? Then show how the two dimensions interact or feed off of one another.
* Choose a set of two or more sonnets and describe how the <span class="key">ritual</span> and <span class="key">fictional</span> dimensions unfold through this group or <span class="key">sequence</span>.
* Write about how a poem embodies the first, second, and <span class="key">third voice</span> described by Eliot.
* Show how a poem embodies the <span class="key">hyperbolic</span> mode identified by Culler in his four parameters. Then show how this hyperbolic mode is intertwined with any of the other <span class="key">four parameters</span>: enunciative-apparatus, re-performance, or being-event.
* Show how a poem's <span class="key">conceit</span> pertains to ritual, fiction, or the various modes of address in Culler/Eliot's texts.

### Specifications
<ol style="margin-left:3em">
<li> Respond to the prompt. This means you must cite and be in conversation with the relevant theoretical text.
<li> The first paragraph should include a question or conjecture.
<li> The last paragraph should reconstruct your argument and reflect on what is unresolved, and/or propose routes for further inquiry.
<li> Sentences should be sequenced in a way that makes sense. If entering digressive, disjunctive territory, issue a warning and return to the previous point as soon as possible.
<li> Provide vivid evidence of your claims by quoting directly and concisely from the text. Include block quotes only where especially apt or where you plan on engaging in prolonged commentary on specific words throughout the quote.
<li> Avoid clichés. Take care to follow up on general claims with a more specific discussion of how that claim pertains to your argument and the poem(s).
<li> Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially prepositions and verbs. Use the simplest word possible in most cases. Don't use terms like "semantics" when "meaning" suffices.
<li> Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, free of grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
<li> Sentences should be varied in length and syntax in a way that helps the reader stay engaged throughout the reading process. Avoid needless repetition of words or sentence structures.
<li> Use subjective language when you are making a claim that you don’t expect most readers could see for themselves. Otherwise, use objective language (e.g. “The poem does x”) or the first-person plural (e.g. “We observe that”). Use the proper tense (mostly the simple present).
<li> Include a title that neatly sums up your paper, e.g. "Essay 2 – Ritual and Fiction in Rilke's New Poems"
<li> Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the "Appendix" of your paper. Tip: use template on Canvas.
<li> Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. If typing up meter, do it in a consistent style, following the guidelines from Essay 1.
<li> The paper should be relatively free of typographical errors.
<li> The body of the paper should be 4-5 pages.
</ol>

### Grading criteria

A: 15/15  
A-: 13-14/15  
B+: 10-12/15  
B: 6-9/15  
B-: Satisfies instructions 1-5

Submit your best work the first time around, even if that means turning in your paper slightly late (within 24 hours of the due date). The rubric is not designed to be "evaluative," but to give concrete pointers for the revision process. All essays which do not receive 15/15 should be revised. The grade is assigned based on this revision unless you do not revise. You can only submit one round of revision so be sure to ask questions prior to submitting the second and final draft. The deadline for revisions is generally one week after the instructor returns feedback.



### Looking Ahead

Like the previous essay, this prompt allows you to practice reading a poem using specific terms and methodologies inherited from another text. However, it is a bit more open-ended and should give you a better feel for what kind of methods you prefer to use in the final paper. This essay also opens the avenue for writing about groups or sequences of poems, and for incorporating a wider array of external resources.
