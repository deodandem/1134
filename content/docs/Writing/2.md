# Essay 2 - "Ritual and Fiction"

Due Wednesday, 10/16 at 22:00,  
Revisions due on 10/26 at 22:00

### Prompt
As we have discussed in class, lyric poems may be defined in terms of their “ritual” and “fictional” elements, in terms of the "four parameters," or in terms of the "three voices." Choose a poem (or several short ones) and demonstrate how it embodies any of these categories. You may choose to use only one of these theoretical approaches, or a blend of several. Here are some sub-prompts you may choose to address:


* Choose a poem and identify specific words and lines where the <span class="key">ritual</span> element is particularly salient. Then consider how the poem inhabits a <span class="key">fictional</span> space—How it might be narrated as in a novel or film? Who is speaking? What is being described? What are the relationships between the speaker(s) and object(s) in the “scene” of the poem? Then show how the two dimensions interact or feed off of one another.
* Choose a set of two or more sonnets and describe how the <span class="key">ritual</span> and <span class="key">fictional</span> dimensions unfold through this group or <span class="key">sequence</span>.
* Write about how a poem embodies the first, second, and <span class="key">third voice</span> described by Eliot.
* Show how a poem embodies the <span class="key">hyperbolic</span> mode identified by Culler in his four parameters. Then show how this hyperbolic mode is intertwined with any of the other <span class="key">four parameters</span>: enunciative-apparatus, re-performance, or being-event.
* Show how a poem's <span class="key">conceit</span> pertains to ritual, fiction, or the various modes of address in Culler/Eliot's texts.

### Specifications
<ol style="margin-left:3em">

<li> The first paragraph should capture the reader's attention and induce some level of curiosity by effectively pointing out why the poem you are writing about is interesting and why the theoretical term you are using is relevant to that poem.
<li> Respond persuasively to the prompt. How do you understand the theoretical term you are citing? In what ways is it helpful for reading, interpreting, or gaining a better appreciation for the poem(s) you are writing about? Are you using the term exactly as the original author intended it to be used, or are you modifying it slightly and/or taking it into a new context? Convince the reader that using these terms, or your modifications of them, is a worthwhile endeavor.
<li> Include a question in your introduction (first or second paragraph), as a brief synopsis of the rest of your essay.
<li> The last paragraph should reconstruct your argument and reflect on what is unresolved, and/or propose routes for further inquiry. It's a good idea to include a question here too.
<li> Provide vivid evidence of your claims by quoting directly and concisely from the text. Avoid commonplace statements (clichés). Include block quotes only where especially apt or where you plan on engaging in prolonged commentary on specific words throughout the quote.

<li> Sentences should be sequenced in a way that is clearly motivated and which propels the reader's interest forward. Pay special attention to the last and first sentences of each paragraph, which should act as the connective thread of the essay.
<li> Sentences should be as concise and clear as possible, employing more complex and vibrant language where appropriate. Interweave short and long, simple and complex; use contrasts to your advantage. Avoid unwarranted repetition of words and phrases.
<li> Exercise care in choosing words precisely, especially adjectives, prepositions and verbs. Use the simplest word possible in most cases. Define terms that may have a specialized or otherwise non-obvious meaning.
<li> Use the proper tense (mostly the simple present).
<li> Use subjective language when you are making a claim that you don’t expect most readers could see for themselves. Otherwise, use objective language (e.g. “The poem does x”) or the first-person plural (e.g. “We observe that”).

<hr style="border: .5px solid rgb(147,141,123); margin: 2em auto; width: 40%">

<li> Include a title that neatly sums up your paper. This normally takes the form of <i>Noun-Phrase + Prepositional-Phrase</i>, e.g. "Ritual and Fiction in Rilke's New Poems."
<li> Transcribe the poem and include at the beginning of your paper if it fits in one page, after the title. Otherwise attach the poem in the "Appendix" of your paper and cite line numbers from the Appendix. Tip: Use template on Canvas.
<li> Use proper MLA formatting and citation style, 1.7 spacing, and a Works Cited page. If typing up meter, do it in a consistent style, following the guidelines from Essay 1.
<li> The paper should be relatively free of typographical and spelling errors, which includes extra spaces. Take care to put periods and commas inside quotation marks.
<li> The body of the paper should be around 4 pages.
</ol>

### Grading criteria

A: 15/15  
A-: 13-14/15  
B+: 11-12/15  
B: 6-10/15  
B-: Satisfies instructions 1-5

Submit your best work the first time around, even if that means turning in your paper slightly late (within 24 hours of the due date). The rubric is not designed to be "evaluative," but to give concrete pointers for the revision process. All essays which do not receive 15/15 should be revised. The grade is assigned based on this revision unless you do not revise. You can only submit one round of revision so be sure to ask questions prior to submitting the second and final draft. The deadline for revisions is generally one week after the instructor returns feedback.



### Looking Ahead

Like the previous essay, this prompt allows you to practice reading a poem using specific terms and methodologies inherited from another text. However, it is a bit more open-ended and should give you a better feel for what kind of methods you prefer to use in the final paper. This essay also opens the avenue for writing about groups or sequences of poems, and for incorporating a wider array of external resources.
